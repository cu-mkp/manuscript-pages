<ab>Take a dozen dried <m>common</m> <m>walnuts</m> and throw them one after another onto a good brazier where they may catch fire, and take them out with tongs, and let them burn and flame well in the air, and extinguish them in a glass of good <m>wine</m>. Then let the <m>wine</m> cool and filter it, then pour half of it, since six extinguished <m>nuts</m> make one dose. An excellent cure against suffocation of the matrix.</ab>
