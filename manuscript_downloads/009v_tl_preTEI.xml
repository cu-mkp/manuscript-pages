<ab>They melt <m>orpiment</m> entirely in a <m>glass</m> bottle on very hot <m>ashes</m>, but it would be more appropriate to sublimate <m>orpiment</m> in a long-neck matrass as for making <m>garnets</m>. The <m>orpiment</m> thus turns red like <m>red enamel</m> and it has to be ground first in distemper, because once entirely melted it is very brittle and difficult to grind. Then, once dry, you can thin it with <m>oil</m> and it will make a deep and saturated yellow. But to prevent <m>orpiment</m> from fading [in contact] with other colours and make it compatible with these and to make it dry quickly, a most rare secret is to calcine common <m>salt</m> and to grind it together <sup>with the <m>orpiment</m></sup>. <m>Green verditer</m> is not used with <m>oil</m>.</ab>
