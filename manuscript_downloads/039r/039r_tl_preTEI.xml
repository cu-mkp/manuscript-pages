<ab>They assemble <m>silver filings</m> with <m>saltpeter</m> which refines it &amp; does not make it brittle. But <m>gold filings</m> are assembled with <m>borax</m> or, to spare the <m>borax</m>, with <m>lead</m>, which refines the <m>gold</m> &amp; softens it, for the <m>saltpeter</m> would make it brittle, which <m>silver</m> does not do. This is why, to save money, <pro>goldsmiths</pro> use it to assemble, in order to spare <m>borax</m>, which costs viii <cn><fr>sols</fr></cn> per <ms>ounce</ms>, &amp; <m>saltpeter</m> x <cn><fr>sols</fr></cn> per <ms>lb</ms>.</ab>


<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths</pro> have thus assembled their <m>silver filings</m> with <m>saltpeter</m>, a <m>red enamel</m> vitrifies at the bottom of the <tl>crucible</tl>. I do not know if the <m>copper</m> mixed in with the <m>silver</m> is the cause. <rub>Try for <m>enamel</m></rub>.</ab>

<ab>It is grown in <pl>Lauragais</pl> where the deep soil is so fertile that every year wheat was grown there, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why <m>dyers’ woad</m> and wheat are grown there alternately. For cultivating <m>dyers’ woad</m>, the soil is ploughed with <tl><m>iron</m> shovels</tl>, as <pro>gardeners</pro> do. Next, it is harrowed with <tl>rakes</tl>, &amp; broken up finely as for sowing some <pa>kitchen herbs</pa>. It is commonly sown on <tmp>Saint Anthony's day in January</tmp>. Eight harvests are made. The first ones are better. The best <m>dyers’ woad</m> of <pl>Lauragais</pl> is the one from <pl>Carmail</pl> &amp; the one from <pl>Auragne</pl>. And sometimes the <m>dyers’ woad</m> is good in one field &amp; in the one close by it will hardly have worth. The goodness of the <m>dyers’ woad</m> can be recognized when put in the mouth it gives the taste of <m>vinegar</m>, or when crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some mold-like veins which are as it were golden or silver. It is assayed in the <tl><pro>dyers</pro>' vat</tl>, and to fill a <tl>vat</tl> with it, six <ms>bales</ms> of it are needed. There several flocks of <m>wool</m> are dyed, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be worth 15 <cn>florins</cn>, if it gives xx dyings, xx <cn>florins</cn>. The good kind dyes up to 30 times &amp; commonly up to xxv or 26.</ab>
