<ab>They take a little <m>turpentine</m> &amp; oil of <m>turpentine</m> or of <m>spike lavender</m> &amp;  <m>amber</m> pulverized &amp; passed very subtly &amp; make as that of <m>mastic</m>, &amp; add in to color it a little <m>dragon's blood</m> and make it reddish, and others some <m>terra merita</m> for yellow.</ab>

<ab>You have to work the ground, then then it with a rake, and afterwards if it is dry you must <m>wet</m> it. Then stretch a cord clean on the ground, and along its length hit the cord with the back of a pruning knife, so that the cord marks a right line. Along its length you will make holes with an <m>iron</m> stake, where you will plant rosemary, its head lopped off &amp; cut to measure and thinned out at the foot.</ab>

<ab>To well <m>tin</m> nails and other work, they file their work very neatly. Then to clean it well &amp; rid it of fattiness, they make it boil in <m>vinegar</m>, then they wipe it well with a <m>linen</m>. Next they heat it &amp; pass some <m>resin</m> over top, which coats it with a shiny skin like varnish. This done, they melt some pure &amp; fine <m>tin</m> in their <m>estamiere</m>, which is a <m>little square iron box.</m> And when the <m>tin</m> is well melted &amp; moderately warm, they throw in  <m>resin</m> in to burn the filth, &amp; then they let the head of a nail or something similar soak a little, &amp; having remained there for seven or eight pauses, they take it out and shake it, hitting the top with an <m>iron</m> to make the tin that is superfluous fall off, &amp; clean it with a small stick wrapped in <m>tow</m>. And if it is not well <m>tin</m>ned, you will hit it hot with a piece of <m>resin</m> &amp; do as before before &amp; leave it to get cold. When the work cools down it becomes yellow, which is a sign that the <m>tin</m> is the right temperature. But it becomes blue if the <m>tin</m> is too hot. Things so <m>tin</m>ned are of a duration, &amp; do not come undone at all, like the tinning done by leaves. But at the end of a year they can be clarified &amp; renewed by heating &amp; striking them.</ab>


<ab><pro>Leadsmiths</pro> say that making a lizard die in the <m>melted tin</m> makes the <m>tin</m>ning become very golden. Or else by adding <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>
