<ab>again quite strongly, and then add to it three ℥ of <m>minium</m>, pound again together and put it in the crucible. Cover it with an appropriate <m>tile</m>, not too thick, so the heat reverberates better. Then put it on the grid of your furnace, after having put a few thick, rounded <m>tiles</m> under it. Then fill your furnace to the mouth with <m>charcoal</m>, heaped to the top, and let it glow for a while, and always maintain the heat even, without letting the <m>charcoal</m> diminish. And for that purpose, make sure that the furnace is heaped full brim and maintain it like this for one day. The first experiment I made only produced a <m>yellow mass</m> like <m>minium</m> alone when vitrified, with <m>gold</m> grains, in a mass at the bottom. Try cemented <m>gold</m> together with <m>antimony</m>.</ab><m>

If you need more heat, put around the mouth of the glowing furnace some <m>tiles</m> one against the other in order to make the heat reverberate.</note>

<ab>The same dose is used for all jewels, which is one weight of <m>calcined <m>pebbles</m> with three weights of <m>minium</m>, all pounded separately in a <m>copper</m> mortar for <m>emeralds</m>, and in an <m>iron</m> mortar for <m>topazes</m> or <m>amber</m> color</m>, with pestles of the same <sup>matter</sup> as the mortars. <m>Emeralds</m> and <m>topazes</m> need to be heated at the same temperature, and for an hour and a half, otherwise they could be burnt. <m>Rubies</m> need more time and stronger <m>heat</m>, and <sup>to be</sup> colored with <m>gold</m> leaf. I believe that for <m>rubies</m> <m>pumice stone</m> or <m>fire-stone</m> would be better. See <m>enamels</m>. Instead of pebbles, try also to mix pieces of <m>colored glass</m> or <m>enamels</m>. If the mass is not colored enough, pound it further in the <m>iron</m> mortar.</ab>

Slightly burnt <m>tartar</m> mixed in makes beautiful yellow, but not much is needed. <m>Sand</m> also makes it more yellow.</note>

<head><m>Salt</m> for melting</head>


<ab>Mix some <m>saltpeter</m> and <m>common salt</m> and melt them together and throw them onto <m>copper</m>, molte or "en bain", which purifies it and makes it run marvellously. First you need to decrepitate [?] <m>ordinary salt,</m> which means holding it over strong heat until it crackles no more; or to melt it better, in an air-furnace. Throw it neatly onto a <m>marble</m> <sup>slab</sup>, then pound it and grind it very finely, then put it in a crucible on an equal quantity of <m>saltpeter</m>. Let them boil and mix them together until</ab>
