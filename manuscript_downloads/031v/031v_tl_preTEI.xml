<ab>Scribes make darker shades of <m>lake</m> and other colors for clothing with <m>egg yolk</m>, but this is a fraud and does not last.</ab>


<ab>Others glaze <m>rouges de mine</m> and other [colors] that are not beautiful in <m>oil</m> using <m>egg white</m> so that they seem to be done in <m>oil</m>. But humidity damages all that.</ab>

<ab>For blue, they take some of the roughest <m>azure d'email</m> and grind it on shale, and mix in two or three rosary beads' worth of <m>lead rock</m> or more, according to the quantity of work. And having done their drawing with <m>noir d'escaille</m> (which is painted towards the light with the piece of <m>glass</m> upright), they lay all their pieces down over white <m>paper</m> so that by the whiteness of the <m>paper</m> they can judge the lighting of their scenes and put down all colors of the same kind at the same time. Then they reheat.</ab>
