<ab>There are <m>sapphires</m> that one calls trellis <sup>sapphires</sup>, for they are pierced and it is said that a certain king had a certain ornament in the shape of a trellis made out of these, as perhaps the Screen of Charlemagne, as it is named, would be, in the treasure of <pl>Saint Denis</pl>, in which the gemstones are set without foil, so as to enjoy their luminosity from both sides, &amp; to show their vividness. I have a white one that seems to be rough &amp; pierced, and is all over spotted with blue blemishes; I am of the opinion that these are artificial &amp; made of <m><fr>taffre</fr></m> or very clear azure <m>enamel</m> fused on the <m>sapphire</m>. <add>A <tl>file</tl> bites into it as it does with <m>beryl</m>.</add></ab>

<ab>It is imitated &amp; cut with half dried <pa>marigold</pa> leaves, &amp; twisted like a thread, &amp; placed in the hottest sun to dry, &amp; is mixed, &amp; the aforesaid <pa>marigold</pa> even gives some color.</ab>

<ab><pro>Stone cutters</pro> sometimes choose old pieces of antique <m>glass</m> in church windows, which are much thicker than those of today &amp; are of more vivid colors. If it is for <fr><del>souf</del></fr> <m>sapphire</m>, they choose beautiful blue &amp; from such a place that there are no <del>pieces</del> grains, if it is possible. And having cut it into squares with <m>emery</m>, they cut it in bevel &amp; polish it. In this manner, they imitate very beautiful <m>sapphires</m>. The old azure <m>enamel</m> for <m>silver</m>, verging on aquamarine, was very suitable for imitating <m>sapphires</m>, but it is scarcely found. <m>Aquamarines</m> are imitated with white <m>glass</m>, but they take it from the bottom of the glass.</ab>

<head><m>Amber</m></head>
<ab>The orange color of transparent <m>amber</m>, and of the other one which has body, is not internal, for it is whitish on the inside. But it acquires this reddish crust with age or through the wearing of it. This is why those who cut it with a file or on the wheel do not remove this crust if it is possible. But rather they only polish it, rubbing it with a <m>willow</m> stick or other soft wood dipped into <m>water</m> &amp; dusted with <pl>Brittany</pl> <m>tripoli</m>, and it takes a beautiful polish. If it is too straw yellow, &amp; you want to intensify its color, hang it inside a chimney where there is much <m>soot</m> &amp; smoke, and it will take on a reddish-orange color. Try to take the most whitish transparent one, and put it under <m>manure</m> to turn it green, as with bones. Or smoke it in a closed space, in <m><fr>safre</fr></m> or <m>manganese</m> smoke &amp; other drugs that you know of. Or in <m>urine</m> and <m>distilled vinegar</m> mixed with colors, or in the vapor of <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m> boiling in <m>copper</m>, or <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m> boiling with <m>silver</m> &amp; <m><lat>sal ammoniac</lat></m>; &amp; some cut facets in the <m>amber</m> on a wheel of <m>soft wood</m> with <m>putty</m> instead of <m>emery</m>, &amp; <m>jet</m> also. The salt called <fr>de Langlois de armonic</fr> is a mineral salt that resembles <m>marble</m> stone and is a very hard mineral with large pieces, like that of <pl>Cardona</pl> and <pl>Monserrat</pl>.</ab>

I have experienced that it turns reddish on the surface when boiled in <m>lye</m> or <m>corrosive water</m>. And if it is scrubbed with <m>fir</m> and <m>soft wood</m> before cooling down, it is easily cut.</ab>
