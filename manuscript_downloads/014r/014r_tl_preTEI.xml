<head>For <m>earth</m> walls and rustic construction</head>


<ab><al>Swallows</al> have taught us this craft by building their nests out of <m>mud</m> mingled with <m>wisps</m> and bits of <m>hay</m> or <m>straw</m> to make it bond. Therefore, in places where <m>stones</m> and <m>bricks</m> are lacking, one can use <m>earth</m> to make walls thin and thick. The best for this is light <m>earth</m>, which does not form clumps when plowed, or better, that which in some way mingled with <m>arene</m>, because it can be most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into clumps with a <tl>ditch-spade</tl>, and put and placed in this form. This one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn't make it split or crack. However, since such kinds of earth are not found everywhere, those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their foundations with a <tl>rope</tl>, drive in long <tl>poles</tl> and <tl>rafters</tl> along the edges on each side to support boards between which they throw the <m>earth</m>, making each layer about one foot thick, interspersed with <figure>S.S.S</figure>-shaped branches of <m><pa>heather</pa></m> or similar things, then they tamp it down and beat it with beaters of three different forms. One is called the mall, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used firstly to tamp down the <m>earth</m>. Then one uses another made of pointed <tl>woodblocks</tl> fitted onto a thick <tl>stick</tl>, and this one is used to properly press the <m>earth</m> at the wallâ€™s ends and edges where they adhere to the boards, and is called <gap/>. The other one is called the bat and is used to flatten and beat the <m>earth</m> for the last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of <m>earth</m> and <m><pa>heather</pa></m> and beats as has been said, and continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with <m><pa>heather</pa></m> and then with <m>earth</m>. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of <m>bricks</m>. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it whitens, showing that it has <m>saltpeter</m> in it. Which is why, when they fall down, <pro>gunpowder makers</pro> profit from them.</ab>
