<ab>To dry jams that are [not?] liquid, have an open tub pierced on each side with a small, square window, and pass sticks through these from one side to the other, and place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a net. And on this, you will neatly put your jam containers. And having put at the bottom of the tub a hot coal or two, cover the tub with a cloth folded in two.</ab>

<head>Dogs</head>


<ab>To keep them from biting, it is good to have <m>pitch</m> balls, formed like those of cobblers, to throw to them when they yap at you. They will bite on the balls so much that their teeth will get stuck together and they will not be able to harm you.</ab>
