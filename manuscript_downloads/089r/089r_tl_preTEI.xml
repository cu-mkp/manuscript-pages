<head>Powder of <m>ox bone</m> and <m>rock salt</m></head>


<ab>I pulverised them separately and ground them finely on the <m>porphyry</m> as much as I could. Then I mixed all of one with the other and re-ground it on the <m>porphyry</m>. Afterwards I moistened it in <m>paper</m> folded in a moist <m>napkin</m> which is made wet more quickly from the <m>moisture of the night</m>, or the <m><sup>moisture of</sup> the cellar</m>. I have never found <sup>one</sup> which can be removed more cleanly from the mold than this, though it needs to be quite moist. And if you want to cast small works, make it very hot. It came out very cleanly from the doulx tin, like the main one, and has sustained several castings. For <m>tin</m>, I believe that it is not necessary to look further to find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use with fine <m>lead</m> which has almost better results than <m>tin</m><del>Tou</del>. The <m>bone of an ox hoof</m> is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty <m>sand</m>, so it will bind like <m>tripoli</m>, <m>salts</m>, <m>felt</m>, <m>ashes</m> and similar materials. <sup>If you do not mix <m>ox-hoof bone</m></sup>, it will not turn out from the mold and will not mold cleanly because it crumbles.</ab>

<ab>Always arrange the most delicate parts, like faces or handles, so that nothing will fall which would then disturb your fusion.</ab>

<ab>This should not be reheated for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>, it is <del/> better all new and fresh.</ab>
