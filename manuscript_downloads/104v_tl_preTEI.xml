<head>For casting</head>


<ab>If you’ve got a big piece which does not allow an easy stripping of casting, mold it with some <m>wax</m>, either on the hollow side or in relief, because it is soft and hollow and so can easily be separated from the piece without leaving anything. But be sure that the melted <m>wax</m> is neither too hot nor too cold. Some people use for molding some <m>wax</m> warmed in <m>boiled water</m>, but while pressing the mold it bends and becomes unusable. Once you have made your <m>wax</m> cavity, you can cast in some very soft and clear <m>clay</m>, and let it dry. Then, upon it you will make a <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> cavity, in which what you will make will easily be stripped.</ab>

<ab>Make an axis surrounded with wheels, pierce all around in its thickness and attach some feathers [as you would do] for a timbrel or a spinet and arrange them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable distance. And, turning the axis by yourself or using a clock spring, your invention will work.</ab></root>
