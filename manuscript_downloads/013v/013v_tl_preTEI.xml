<head>To recognize the good kind of <m>azurite ash</m> for <m>oil</m></head>


<ab>The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is delicate. Also the one that is also very pale in color, because <m>oil</m> darkens it. Certain <pro>sophisticators</pro> mix them, but you will know this if you pour some onto a piece of <m>paper</m> &amp; lay it flat &amp; smudge it with the <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> since, if it is mixed, it will be found variegated &amp; as if with pale &amp; darker stripes, but if it is unmixed it will be even &amp; of one color.

<ab>That which comes from the head of the <al>toad</al> and has the shape of the <al>toad</al>, painted naturally as you have seen, is the most excellent.

<ab>It is said that if one calls a <al>snake</al> in Greek, saying <gk>ΟΦΗ ΟΦΗ</gk>, it will flee. Likewise, if one <del><fr>nom</fr></del> calls a <al>swine</al> in Greek, <del><fr>y</fr></del> <gk>ïon</gk>, it will come.
