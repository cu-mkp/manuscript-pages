<ab>The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is finer. Also the one that is also very pale in color, because <m>oil</m> darkens it. Certain sophists mix them together, but you will find this out if you pour some onto a piece of <m>paper</m> and lay it flat and spread it with your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> since, if it is mixed, it will be found varied and so to say with light and darker stripes, but if it is whole it will be even and of one color.
