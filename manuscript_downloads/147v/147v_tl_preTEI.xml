<head>Casting with <m>copper</m> alloyed with <m><figure>â˜¾</figure></m>, which is like very low <m>solder</m> and ard<x>...</x>es and <m>old K</m> and some Re out of xii</head>
 
<ab>I have cast the cleanest I have ever seen, making very small figures as thin as paper. I have cast extremely hot in the very red mold, and have put into the melted mixture the two compositions which makes <m>silver</m> runny, and have done as if I wanted to throw with <m>pure silver</m>.  This <m>league</m> is white when it boils, as with every other alloy which contains even just a small bit of <m>silver</m>. To cast something very delicate, use this.</ab>

<ab>There is none better than the one you have used to mold, that is to say lumps from your molds.  But you need to choose some of the better recooked ones.</ab></div>

<ab>Beware that it should be three fingers away from the mouth of the bellows and that the aforesaid bellows is positioned underneath the bottom of the crucible, otherwise it will cool it down.</ab></div>

<head><m>Latten</m> casting</head>
 
<ab>I have taken the one you find in <m>latten</m> skillets, which have been beaten and forged quite thinly.  Having well-heated it, I threw in two or three grains, like beads of <m>sal ammonicac</m>.  This will clarify it like a mirror, having turned very white from all the heating, I threw in it some crushed raw and pure <m>calamine</m>.  The I casted it in its very red mold. Il cast cleanly and thin like <m>paper</m>, and hollow on the back.  Because it has become crusty I cooked it again, which to means to say, I reddened it, and left it to cool, then put it in <m>bleach</m>, made partly with raw <m>tartar</m> and half of common <m>salt</m>.  Having boiled it well, I brushed it in clear <m>water</m>, because the first time it was</ab>
 
<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>Do not let it cool down when melting. It always makes into filaments, as you would find with melted <m>glass</m>, because of the <m>calamine</m>.  Usually, the soft <m>letten</m> of skillets, becomes red from casting, even when it has been in the fire for a longtime, because the <m>calamine</m> evaporates.  But the brittle <m>letten</m> of candleholders becomes yellow, as well as the <m>filings</m> made of needles.</ab>
