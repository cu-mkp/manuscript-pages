<head>For painting in <m>oil</m> on <m>taffeta</m> without the <m>oil</m> running</head>


<ab>You have to make a layer of <m>batture</m>, made of "<m>colle forte</m>" soaked for 24 hours in <m>water</m> then gently boiled so it is not too strong. After, stir in a little <m>honey</m> to soften it and bring it all to a boil. And on top of this layer which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <m>oil</m><m>,</m> which will soften the layer even more, and which will also serve for a layer of <m>gold</m>. <m>Alum water</m> also keeps <m>oil</m> from running.</ab>

<head>Whitening <m>ceruse</m></head>


<ab>Boil some <m>eggs</m>, cut them in half and take the yellow out, and between the two halves of <m>egg white</m>, put a bit of <m>ceruse</m>, and stitch the two halves together with a thread. Then boil the stitched <m>egg</m> in some clear <m>water</m> and the <m>water</m> will become black and in this way the <m>ceruse</m> will stay purified. Some people cook it again over a fire and it becomes very white.</ab>
