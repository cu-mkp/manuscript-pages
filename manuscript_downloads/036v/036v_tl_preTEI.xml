<ab>Kitchen pots are made well, in order not to give a <sn>bad taste to the meat</sn>, with the same <m>metal the bells are made of</m>. It is true that <pro>foun<del><fr>ables</fr></del><add>ders</add></pro> mix in more <m>latten</m> to make them yellower, in order to sell them better. But the <m>latten</m> by itself, &amp;simply by touching it, is <sn>stinking</sn> &amp; <sn>bad smelling</sn>.</ab>


<ab><m>Latten</m> does not lose, or very slightly, its <m>calamine</m> in an <tl>air furnace</tl> when it is melted in a <tl>crucible</tl>, nor does it lose it in a <tl><m>wood</m> furnace</tl>, but it does in a <tl>bellows furnace</tl> because <tl>bellows</tl> give intense flames.</ab>

<ab>It is necessary that the mouth be narrower than the bottom. And it is enough if the <tl>crucible</tl> can enter in it, &amp; if there is enough space to remove &amp; take it with <tl>pincers</tl>.</ab>

<ab>It is said that in <pl>Lorraine</pl> and <pl>Flanders</pl> <m>linking glass</m> is made of <m>fern ashes</m> and <m>pebbles</m>. First they blow up a long still that another worker breaks off and cuts vertically with big shears. Then this long still expands by being placed on a stone or large platine in a furnace slightly colder than one for melting. Furthermore, they flatten it by rolling <sup>over</sup> it a big and long iron stick. Then they take it out of the annealing  furnace. Similarly, they make some in <pl>England</pl> that are quite beautiful. Close to <pl>Rouen</pl> in <pl>France</pl>, flat glass is made with some <m>saltworth</m> and <m>pebbles</m> and is whiter and softer than the <pl>Lorraine</pl> one, because it can be melted with a candle, unlike the <pl>Lorraine</pl> one. This flat <m>glass</m> is blown up in a long still -- the end of which someone else cuts and blows up whilst turning it, then flattens it using a plane which is on the ground, and then reheats it. Thus the middle of the still, where it began, always stays the same.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>The <m>glass</m>, when wet, can be broken again with the flame of a candle, but not as precisely as with hot iron.</ab>
