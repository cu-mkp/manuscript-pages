<ab>Some believe the <m>ceruse</m>-color crust that is on top to be natural. Others say that it is a lost secret of ancient <pro>lapidaries</pro>. Others say that it is <m>enamel</m> that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs.

And after scraping off a little of the white, I found it to be of a clear fleshy tone. Finally, I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could compare with a quite beautiful <m>agate</m> for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful face and applying it to a table of
