<head>For painting in <m>oil</m> on <m>taffeta</m> without the <m>oil</m> running</head>


<ab>One needs to make a layer of <m><fr>batture</fr></m>, which is made of <m><fr>colle forte</fr></m> soaked for 24 hours in <m>water</m> then gently boiled so it is not too strong. Then stir in a little <m>honey</m> to soften it, and bring it all to a boil. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in <m>oil</m>, which will soften the layer even more, and which will also serve to make an underlayer for <m>gold</m>. <m>Alum water</m> also keeps <m>oil</m> from running.</ab>

<head>For whitening <m>ceruse</m></head>


<ab>Hard-boil some <m>eggs</m>, cut them in half and take the <m>yolk</m>s out, and between the two halves of the <m>white</m> put a bit of <m>ceruse</m>, and tie the two halves together with thread. Then boil in clear <m>water</m>, and it will become black, and thus the <m>ceruse</m> will be purified. Some reheat it over fire and it becomes very white.</ab>
