<ab><pl>Germans</pl> who work in miniature make <fr>chassis</fr> not of <m>glass</m>, but of <m>canvas</m> oiled with <m>clear turpentine varnish</m>, namely <ms>half</ms> <m>turpentine oil</m> &amp; <ms>almost half</ms> <m>turpentine</m>, because this light, which is not as bright as <m>glass</m>, makes them see larger features. And when they want to make something subtle like veins <del><fr>de</fr></del> &amp; similar things, they use <tl><fr>pinceaulx</fr> composed of two or three <m><al>rat</al>whiskers</m></tl>.</ab>

<head><m>Azur dâ€™esmail</m> in <m>oil</m></head>


<ab>One needs too choose the most <del> beautiful</del> delicate that will be possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work with it in <m>oil</m>. And if you do not find any that is subtle enough, you can crush it well, not with <m>water</m> but with <m>oil</m>, &amp; crush it thickly. Next lay it on your palette &amp; mix in a little <m>turpentine</m>, but not much, to give it a bond, and make it to be as thick as <m>butter</m> or <m>mortar</m>, &amp; then, with a fairly large <fr>pinceau</fr>, work it by always moving the <fr>pinceau</fr> back and forth. Then, to soften it, hatch across it in a jagged manner with <del>the</del> the tip of the <fr>pinceau</fr>. The highlights will be made with <del><fr>d</fr></del> the same thinned with <m>ceruse</m>, which, giving it a bond, makes it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, &amp; such that you all but struggle to spread it with your <fr>pinceau</fr>. And it is all the better if you lay down your panel. All these difficulties do not arise when it is very subtle &amp; thin without being crushed, and does not run.</ab>

<m>Azure</m> wants to be layered neatly, which is why <del>whe</del> it always dies somewhat when layers it over old, already tarnished, <m>azure</m> to mend an old panel. In such matters, it is better to scrape off the old layer &amp; prime again, then put down the <m>azure</m>. It is thus for almost all other colors. Also, azure crushed with <m>oil</m> always remains shiny, which is not a good sign for <m>azure</m> for this causes it to die.</ab>

<head>Crushing colors</head>


<ab>A slab of <del>marble &amp; <fr>p</fr></del> <m>glass</m> one <del>glass</del> thumb thick is more appropriate than anything else for crushing colours neatly, especially for <m>lake</m> &amp; for <m>whites</m>.</ab>
