<head>Painting metal herbs</head>


<ab>If you are in a hurry it would be better to dilute your color with a <m>gum</m> not too thick because its oil takes a long time to dry, and it runs if thinly applied, as you have to do with herbs. If you are still in a hurry, dilute your color with <m>egg white</m> beaten with <m>fig peels</m>; and your work will soon be dry. But do apply it thinly.</ab>

<head>Wormwood</head>


<ab> The pallid white of this herb is made from <m>green verditer</m>, <m>white lead</m> or <m>ceruse</m>, a bit of <m>massicot</m>, <m>scudegrun</m>, and <m>cendr√© d'azur</m>. Mix and arrange your color with a branch you have. </ab>

<head><al>Viper color</al></head>


<ab> 
It is the most beautiful <al>snake</al> to mold, because it has very beautiful scales, round and transparent. Its natural color is made from good <m>verdigris</m> well ground, with good <m>vinegar</m>, if it is made of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. And in the darkest parts, season this first color with a little <m>sulfur</m>, as you know. And if you need to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub these parts with a rough cloth. Because of its nature, the male ejects a kind of small lump from its backside when pressed, like a half arquebus ball, made in its genitals, and full of highly poisonous prickles.</ab>

<head>Molded roses</head>


<ab> 
Roses are molded with difficulty because of their petals, which are very delicate, weak, and doubled. To avoid this, rub them with <m>wheat oil</m> which is very dessicative, and once dried it stiffens and firms up the leaves to separate them and for them to withstand soaked sand. Do the same thing with <al>flies</al>, pansies, and other delicate things like capers.</ab>
