<ab>The <m>clay</m> mould should be baked until sometimes it becomes red hot, since otherwise the <m>metal</m> would be unstable and be no good at all. Similarly, the inner core must be baked very hard, and mixed with <m>charcoal powder</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Wax</m> for seals and impressions</head>


<ab>For large <m>wax</m> seals, you should always have tepid water handy, and keep your <m>wax</m> in it. Yet previously you should have kneaded it with your hands, so as to make it very smooth and even, for otherwise the water would penetrate the <m>wax</m> and prevent it from holding together. Afterwards, you can imprint whatever you want. Cover the <m>wax</m> in three or four sheets of <m>paper</m>, and, with a round and smooth stick similar to a pestle, roll it out as if to polish it. It will then stick to the <m>paper</m>, helping you to take it off from the seal.  In this way you will imprint better than if you were dripping molten <m>wax</m>. You can carve figures and color them in gold, in silver, or paint them with <m>couleurs à vernis</m>, and transfer them onto a <m>glass</m> pane painted with <m>couleurs à tourmentine &amp; mastic</m>. And if you want to apply these designs by inlaying, use <m>gum ammoniacum</m> mixed with <m>vinegar</m>, and it will stick well.</ab>

<head>Casting in <m>plaster</m></head>


<ab>Melt some <m>wax</m>, and with a big brush coat it over the relief of which you want to have the cave, as if you wanted to paint it. And a light crust will be formed upon which you will cast <m>plaster</m>, to give it shape and consistency. Afterwards, in the cave of the <m>wax</m>, cast your <m>plaster</m> as well to get the relief, and it will come out very easily, because of the <m>wax</m>. This is done more often for large pieces in haut relief than for others.</ab>
