<ab>Two kinds are made in <pl>Toulouse</pl>, one to cover rooms' walls which are finely woven, almost like <m>straw</m> hats worn by villagers, and are made in long rolls, some 10 <m>straws</m> wide, others 13. And they work on them mainly in summer and winter. Then when they prepare it they sew it, but beforehand they dye it in usually three colours: green, red and sometimes purple. The green one is made with only a <m>pastel tincture</m> since green is made from yellow and blue, so the <m>pastel</m> dyes the dark yellow <m>straw</m>. It becomes bright green. For red they use some <m>alum</m> and <m>brazil wood</m>, for purple they use <m>pastel</m> and some <m>coperous</m> which darkens blue with its black tincture.</ab>

<ab>They have no way to produce a perfect red that needs to be annealed. Try, however, the <m><pl>German</pl> red</m> which is scaled red. They produce their ordinary red with some <m>sanguine</m>, <m>iced pewter</m>, <m>lead rocks</m>, and some <m>iron file dust</m>. This red is to be applied on both sides of the <m>glass</m> because it is more colourful. If it were applied on one side only it would look pastel orange.</ab>

<ab>They pay xx <cn>lb</cn> for a <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>rosette</m>, which is harder to melt than <m>latten</m> because it is softer. For, the softer the <m><add>great</add> metals</m> <add><figure>#</figure></add> are, the <del>soft</del> harder they are to melt. The <m>tin used to make bells</m>, which is <m>fine tin</m> <del>is more</del> and which is brittle, is easier to melt than <m>lead, which is soft</m>. <m>Latten, made brittle by the <m>calamine</m></m> is melted more quickly than <m>red copper</m>. The <m>metal, which is the substance of bells</m>, mixed with <m>tin</m>, and very brittle, is soon melted. The more <m>silver</m> is alloyed, the sooner it melts, that is why <m>solder</m> is made with it. In <pl>Germany</pl> they make very light candlesticks, it is because they turn them by means of <m>water</m>, but they are breakable. A <ms>quintal</ms> of <del><fr>per</fr></del> <m>fine <pro>coppersmith</pro>'s rosette</m> is sold for xxx or 40 <cn>lb</cn>. Another type used by <pro>founders</pro> is sold for xii or xv <cn>lb</cn>. The <ms>quintal</ms> of <m>metal</m>, six <cn>lb</cn>.<del>Put in</del></ab>
