<ab>a sign that there is some humidity and if the flower was also watery it would rot. Moreover the sand must not be <del/> rough because its weight would make the flower lose its original shape. Once you have chosen it accordingly, take a <tl>box</tl> in which you first make a layer of sand on which you will display the stalk of the flower laid in a way that the flower does not touch nor the bottom nor the edges of the <tl>box</tl> and stands in the air. Then add more <del/> sand on the stalk so that it remains strong and solid. Finally take some of the same sand and sprinkle and subtly display it with two <tl><bp>fingers</bp></tl> on the flower like the flow of an <ms><tl>hourglass</tl></ms>. And once the flower is <del/> covered, strike with your <bp><tl>fist</tl></bp> the table on which the <tl>box</tl> is displayed, so that the sand lowers and surrounds everything. Finally cover the entire flower, and lay other flowers, one after the other, as many as the <tl>box</tl> can hold. Then put the <tl>box</tl> in <tmp>warm sun</tmp> for <ms><tmp>several days</tmp></ms>. And as the flower dries, the sand that goes with it continues to press and prevents it from rotting and tightening and consequently, it dries and keeps its original shape. And to do so, make sure to chose boufarcis, <pa>marigold</pa>s, the <pa>yellow meadow's flowers</pa> called <la><pa>rammenlus</pa></la> or <la><pa>palta lupina</pa></la>, <pa>amaranth</pa>, and similar flowers like <pa>broom</pa> and others which you will know from experience.</ab>

The sand the <pro>goldsmith</pro>s use to sand <m>enamel</m>s and the white one which the <pro>glassworker</pro>s use and any type of fine sand which does not have much body, put it through a <tl>sieve</tl> made of <m>horsehair</m> because this matter must not be very thin. Then dry it well in the <env>sun</env> for <ms><tmp>several days</tmp></ms> in order to remove the dampness and ventilate it as you would do with <m>wheat</m> so that the dust goes away. Once cleaned of dust and dried, use it as you know.</ab>

<pa>Pansies</pa> can be preserved in the same way.</note>

<head>Keeping fruits throughout the <ms><tmp>year</tmp></ms></head>


<ab>It is necessary to pick them in calm and quite dry weather &amp; by the stem, without <sn>touching</sn> the fruit with the <bp>hand</bp>, and put them into <tl><m>glass</m> bottles</tl> that have wide necks like tall <m>glass</m> <tl>jars</tl> for preserves. Protect them with <m>straw</m> or something else so that they cannot break, and seal them well with <m>wax</m> to keep them from breathing. And if they had <m>glass</m> lids well sealed with <m>wax</m>, it would be all the better. Put them in a <tl>case</tl> and put it in the <env>well</env>, or in the <env>cellar</env>, or in a vat, or a [illegible] of <m>earth</m> full of <m>water</m>.</ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>
Because where the <bp>hand</bp> <sn>touches</sn>, it will rot, and it is even good not to breathe on them.</ab>

You can also put <m>vine leaves</m> there.</ab>
