<head>Tablets</head>
<ab>Some are made from <m>boxwood</m> and inlaid with <m>ebony</m>, <m>sandalwood</m>, <m>ivory</m>, or from <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> like <m>damascening</m>. After that one writes with <tl>silverpoint</tl> and then erases by rubbing them with a <m>cuttlefish bone</m>.</ab>

<head>Making letters easier to read</head>
<ab>One cuts the largest pieces of <m>beryl</m> or <m>crystal</m> round on one side and flat on the other, then one fits it with a little handle and puts the flat side on the letter</ab>

<head>Stamping</head>
<ab>If you have a  <m>bronze</m> medal and you want to make it very light, make a lead cavity, then spread upon it a thin plate of <m>gold</m>, or sheets of <m>lead</m> or reheated <m>silver</m>, place your <m>bronze</m> medal on top and hammer it with a wood <tl>mallet</tl>.</ab>

<head>Softening <m>horn</m></head>
<ab>
Those who mount <del>acou</del> Agnus Deis and make circles from <m>horn</m> for certain little boxes soften the said circles by soaking them in hot <m>water</m> and then shape them on a round or oval-shaped <tl>triblet</tl>.</ab>

<head>Ears</head>
<ab>When a defluxion occurs in the ear, be very careful not to put anything in it, and following the proverb, ears and eyes should only be touched with your elbow. However, to an affected ear, it is good to apply musky <m>cotton</m>, that is to say, cotton kept in <m>musk</m>, which comforts quite well.</ab>

<head>Toothache</head>
<ab>Some put a clove of <m>garlic</m> in the ear on the side of the aching tooth, and after two or three hours they feel better. Others put in their nostril, on the same side as the tooth that hurts, some green skin scraped from the stem of <fr>bisaube</fr>, namely that which is under the grey one that looks like a vine.</ab>
