<head>Ears</head>
<ab>When a defluxion occurs in the ear, be very careful not to put anything in it, and following the proverb, "ears and eyes should only be touched with your elbow". However, to an infected ear, it is good to apply musky <m>cotton</m>, that is to say, cotton kept in <m>musk</m>, which relieves quite well.</ab>

<title>Toothache</head>
<ab>Some put a clove of <m>garlic</m> in the ear on the same side as the aching tooth, and after two or three hours they feel better. Others put in their nostril, on the same side as the tooth that hurts, some green skin scraped from the stem of [plant], namely that which is under the grey one that looks like a stem.</ab>
