<ab>Since <m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> is naturally very dry, <pro>harvesters</pro> thresh it most often in the cool of night and in moonlight. Which could not be done with another, wetter, <m><pa>grain</pa></m>, because you must let the sunbeams pass over it, and one rarely threshes it before midday. Immediately after the <m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> is harvested, the earth needs to be plowed because its roots eat and make lean <sup>the soil</sup> as much as if the <m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> was still standing. The ground where <m><pa><fr>millet</fr></pa></m> will have been sown becomes quite diminished in fertility, which you can tell next time it is sown. But more than any other the <m>grain</m> called <m><pa><fr>pomole</fr></pa></m> in <pl>Gascony</pl>or <m><pa><fr>baillard</fr></pa></m> in <pl><sup>northern</sup> France</pl>, makes the earth shake, according to the common saying, seven years later. <m><pa>Broad beans</pa></m> improve and enrich the soil, provided that one lets the roots and stems rot in it.</ab>

<ab>They commonly have four books. The tiro, which is a formulary for apprentices, by which they can know how much every item of merchandise costs and for how much it should be sold. The second is the waste book, where they put down in rough what they sell daily. The third is the sales book, where they put down the clean copy and detailed account of what is contained in the waste book. The fourth is the ledger, which mentions the sale, the balanced account, the bill and the term of payment, and this book is accepted as evidence in court.</ab>
