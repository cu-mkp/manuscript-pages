<ab>The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some <m>resin</m> or <m>glue</m> but the <m>resin</m> is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered <m>resin</m> on the end melts, in that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in fire.</ab>

<ab>Then the <pro>furbisher</pro> puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small <m>iron</m> tool similar to the <pro>joiners</pro>' bench, they maintain it firmly.  Then with a plane, which is like a two-handled knife, they work the <m>wood</m> piece from the top, then use the <pro>joyner</pro>'s plane to flatten it more.
