<head>Engraving on <m>iron</m></head>


<ab>One ℥ of <m>verdigris</m> and 2 ℥ of <m>coarse salt</m> and a bit of <m>sublimate</m>, or crush some <m>ocher</m> with <m>linseed oil</m>, and use it to cover the blade or the very neat and polished <m>iron</m>. And let it dry on the fire or in the sun. Then, to engrave and make it beautiful, take a small coin’s worth of <m>verdigris</m> twice that quantity of <m>coarse salt</m> and about four grains of <m>ammoniac</m>, and six grains of <m>sublimate</m>, and the <m>water</m> must not be hot.</ab>

<head>How to <m>silver</m> plate <m>copper</m> and <m>latten</m></head>


<ab>Mold the <m>silver</m> as the <m>gold</m>, and put it in the oven in order to get a good <m>gilt</m> pot. And do not let it heat, otherwise the <m>silver</m> would tarnish. Once it will be well spread, make it boil in <m>walnut oil</m>, and then heat it a bit, and put it [into the <m>water</m> the <pro>silversmiths</pro> use to bleach their works].</ab>

<ab>Soak some <m>wheat flour</m> in w<m>hite wine</m>, and slop and cover the whole <m>carnelian</m>. Then cook the <m>violet</m> again, then soak it into <m>white wine</m> for one or two hours, then rub it and leave the part you want to keep on it, then lay on some more on top again.</ab></root>
