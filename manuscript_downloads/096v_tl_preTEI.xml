<head>Grey hilts</head>


<ab>When they are white, it is necessary only to clean them well, and then to heat them over a <m>fire</m>, and make them turn blue. And take care that they do not turn too blue, since neither <m>gold</m> nor <m>silver</m> nor any <m>colo[ring agent]</m> would set. To accomplish this, which is called "les faire passer," have a caldron full of <m>ashes</m> that you cover with some <m>blazing hot charcoal</m>, and heat the <m>ashes</m> thus very well, for an hour or two. And when the <m>ashes</m> are very hot, put the <m>charcoal</m> aside and put the hilt where the <m>charcoal</m> was, and cover it completely with <m>ashes</m>. And when the body, i.e. the main part of the hilt, is completely colored, flip it onto the other side. In that way, the grey cannot color it too dark, unless some <m>hot coal</m> touches it. Greying can be achieved in an ordinary fireplace, too, but there is a risk that it may become too dark and get sooty, which would prevent the color from setting. Blue coloring is obtained as soon as the <m>ashes</m> have heated the hilts a little bit, but it will always be grey on the sides. After blue comes grey.</ab>

<head>Color of water</head>


<ab>For the color of water, use a soft file on the hilts to whiten them, then the burnisher. Afterwards, you color them blue until they become grey. Then, when they are still slightly hot, <m>sanguine</m> is used on them, and, as soon as they are getting cold, you turn them to reheat them, since the color of water is only obtained after a few times. And if hilts weren't warm, the bloodstone would scrape them and undo the color. Pay attention that hilts don't become too grey, since they would give off soot that would prevent the color from setting. Almost one day is necessary to prepare, soften and set the color of water, but as soon as they turn a little blue, it is enough for grey or other colors. Grey is the lesser color, after <m>varnish</m> that is of two colors, either yellow or black.</ab>

<head><m>Yellow varnish</m></head>


<ab>Whiten vigorously and clean the hilts well. After that, with a feather, you coat them entirely, when they are cold, with <m>nut oil</m>. Then, turn them over a nice <m>charcoal fire</m> typical of the <pro>furbishers</pro>' furnace without letting them touch the <m>charcoal</m> or ashes. And when they stop smoking, it is done.</ab>
