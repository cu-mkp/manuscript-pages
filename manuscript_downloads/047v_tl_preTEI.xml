<head>A beverage which tastes like wine</head>


<ab>Take <m>tartar</m> from large vessels, dilute it in <m>water</m>, and it will taste like wine.</ab>

<head><m>Melting</m></head>


<ab>To make it flow neatly, take half <m>metal</m> and half <m>copper</m>. Others take a measure of <m>potin</m> and a measure of <m>latten</m>. Others take a measure of <m>latten</m> from candlesticks and a measure of <m>latten</m> from a basin. And among basins, the <m>latten</m> from larger ones is harder than that from skillets because the material must be softer in order to give them such a small circumference. For the large ones [basins], whose circumference is more ample, one may take a harder material. The harder the <m>latten</m>, the better it flows and the neater it casts, but it must be cast very hot. As one wishes to cast, one should put  <m>lead</m> on the material, which makes it flow, run and smoke, but be careful that the mold does not get damaged. And if you want to cast pieces on <m>fire</m>, mix more <m>rosette</m> than <m>latten</m>, so that it is less brittle. The <pro>founder</pro>’s mould used to melt <m>metal</m> should be better that those used by <pro>glassmakers</pro> because glass is not as heavy as <m>metal</m>. And in this instance, one should coat the <pro>founder</pro>’s mold with <m>earth</m> and crushed <m>glass</m>.</ab>

<ab>Those made during the winter or wet weather are not good. Those used by founders must be thick and need to be coated with <m>clay</m>.</ab>

<ab>Finely-<m>calcinated</m> <m>pumice stone</m> casts 22 carat <m>gold</m> without [needing] repair. But it should be ablaze and red as the metal. It will survive many casts.</ab></root>
