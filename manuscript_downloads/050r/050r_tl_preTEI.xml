<head>Preserving fruit for the entire year</head>


<ab>Take a rounded <m>glass</m> phial, with a large enough opening to receive cherries and plums and whatever fruit you want.  Put in some <m>hot water</m> <sup>and leave it</sup> for two hours, and once your <m>water</m> is cold, throw it out and turn the phial upside down onto its opening on a perfectly even table and in a room where there is not a bit of draft or wind. Then prepare a stopper of fresh <m>wax</m>, wrapped in <m>oilcloth</m>, and adapt it precisely to the <m>glass</m> phial so that it will be ready to stop it once you have put in the fruit.  And once you have hand-picked the fruit, only the non-rotten fruit, and on a warm and dry day, withdraw to the room, well closed so that no wind or draft can get in, and put it gently and deftly in the bottle. Then stop the bottle well with the stopper and lute it, making your lute, if you want, with some <m>quicklime</m> and <m>oil</m>, so that no <m>water</m> gets in. Then put your bottles into a tub full of <m>water</m>, in a cellar, during the summer, and in the winter put your bottles into a basket filled with some weights and lower it to the bottom of a deep well. Because in the winter the <m>water</m> in the tub would be too cold if your cellar is not warm enough, because the <m>water</m> needs to be like <m>river water</m>.</ab></div>

<head>Molding</head>


<ab>If you want to promptly mold something in <fr>demy relief</fr> that comes to hand, fold some <tl><m>paper</m></tl> in five or six doubles, &amp; place it on the <tl>medal</tl> &amp; make sure the <tl><m>paper</m></tl> is folded on the back of the <tl>medal</tl> so that it is well secured. Next take a <tl>stick</tl>, broad at one end &amp; pointed at the other, well softened and rub well on the <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, &amp;with the point of the <tl>stick</tl> retrace the lines &amp;  proceed until you recognize that your impression is well done. Then, at your convenience, slightly rub <m>oil</m> with a <tl><fr>pinceau</fr></tl> <del><fr>lemp</fr></del> on the <tl><m>>paper</m></tl> impression and cast in <m>tallow</m> or <m>wax</m> or <m>sulphur</m>, &amp; the <tl><m>paper</m></tl>, without it burning, will render your design neat, so that you will be able to mold it later in <m>plaster</m> or <m>tripoli</m>, and then in <m>lead</m> &amp; other <m>metal</m>.</ab>
