<head>To polish a <m>ruby balay</m></head>
 
<ab>Unlike others, you don't polish it with <m>tripoli</m>, but with <m>marcasite powder</m> and <m>oil</m>.</ab></div>

<head>Ground <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m></head>


<ab>You have to calcine your <m>pure gold</m> with <figure><m>☿</m></figure> and then let your amalgam dry well and the said <m>mercury</m> fly off. Then crush it on <m><tl>marble</tl></m> with <m>gummed water</m>. As for <m>silver</m> you have to use it in its raw form and corrode it with <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m>, then take it out with a <m>copper</m> blade and rinse it well and then grind it with <m>gum water</m>.</ab></div>

<head>Polishing <m>stones</m></head>
<ab>There are three wheels for this purpose, one of <m>tin</m>, one of <m>lead</m>, and one of pure <m>copper</m>. On the <m>copper</m> wheel, only <m>diamonds</m>, <m>rubies</m>, <m>sapphires</m> and oriental <m>jacinths</m> are usually polished. The <m>tin</m> wheel is for softer stones such as <m>emeralds</m>, <m>amethysts</m> and others.</ab></div>

<head><pro>Pewterers</pro>' mixture</head>


<ab>Because they often mix in with the pure <m>tin</m> half the quantity of <m>lead</m>, which renders the <m>tin</m> deaf. To correct this, they mix in some <m>latten</m> filings to make it resonant.</ab></div>

<head>Perfect amalgam</head>
<ab>Take the finest <m>sandstone</m> you can find and make a cavity in the middle. And put in it an eighth part of <figure><m>☿</m></figure> and rub it and wear it down while adding some <m>water</m> with <figure><m>☾</m></figure> or <figure><m>☼</m></figure> until the material becomes paste-like and even harder. Then, if you want, corrode it with good <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m>, if it is <figure><m>☾</m></figure> or <figure><m>♀</m></figure>. Then melt it again, having taken it out as you know. The <figure><m>☾</m></figure> will have some color, and after being melted it will leave some flecks of <figure><m>☼</m></figure>, and the <figure><m>♀</m></figure> will be very fine and will have almost no covering.</ab></div></root>
