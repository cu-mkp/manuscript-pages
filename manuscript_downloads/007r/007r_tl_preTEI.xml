<head>To gild with <m>gold color</m> and <m>tinsel</m></head>


<ab>Once you have colored <sup>or</sup> made your stamped ornament in <m>tin</m> (as previously described), or in <m>iron</m> or <m>copper</m>, you must not put <m>glue</m> as on <m>wood</m>, but just have some fatty <m>oil</m>, which is made in seven or eight days in the sun from <m>walnut oil</m> and <m>white lead</m>, stirring often, or cooked on fire if one should be in hurry. Then, with the <m>oil</m> thus made fatty, grind a little <m>white lead</m>, <m>massicot</m> and <m>black graphite</m>, at discretion, as much of one as of the other. <m>Minium</m> will color the <m>gold</m>. Then apply an even layer of that onto your stamp, taking care you do not fill the hollows. And once it is almost dry, apply the <m>gold</m> leaf on it using <m>cotton</m>. Such <m>gold</m> will withstand rain on houses or elsewhere. And if you have made your gilt with <m>tinsel</m>, color it with <m>smoke from a partridge</m> or from yellow or red <m>cloth</m>, and it will look as fine as pure <m>gold</m>. You can cover trunks, mirrors, bed valances and posts in colored <m>velvet</m> or <m>satin</m> and then apply the gilded stamped ornament on them with strong <m>glue</m>.</ab>

<head>To color stamped ornaments for trunks</head>


<ab>The stamped ornament made from sheets of <m>copper</m> or <m>latten</m> are made with <m>wood from a <pa>service tree</pa></m> engraved and cut, should you want to spend less. Next, the stamped piece is colored with the aforesaid lacquer colours of <m>lacquer</m>, <m>verdet</m>, <m>blue enamel</m>, and soaked in <m>turpentine</m> varnish. But wherever you want to make it azure, apply some fer blanc, which is more appropriate for an azure background.</ab>

<ab>Good <m>dragon's blood</m> soaked in <m>spirits</m> produces its own <m>mastic</m> or <m>glue</m>. So do <m>vert de vessie</m> and <m>saffron</m>.</ab>

<ab>It is made from <m><al>codfish</al> skin</m> that has been boiled rather than <m>salted</m>. <pro>Joiners</pro> use it on their masterpieces and <pro>guitar makers</pro> use it for their more delicate works. It needs to be strongly whipped, then soaked gently in barely boiling <m>water</m>.</ab>


<ab><m>Mouth glue</m> is made of <m>parchment</m> scraps and used to glue <m>paper</m> or similar things without fire, by wetting it with one's <tl><bp>mouth</bp></tl>.</ab>
 
<note>

It is whipped and left to soak in <m>white wine</m> for one night, then melted over a low heat. Others soak it in <m>spirits</m>.</note>
