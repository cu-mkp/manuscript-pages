round <tl>plane</tl>, also two-handed, and then with a small narrow <tl>plane</tl>, it is gutted and scoured for half a foot towards the end of the heel. And a shorter scouring is better so that the sword does not always cut the scabbard.</ab>


<ab>
The opening of the scabbard is called the mouth and on top of it is the shape of the knife.</ab>


<ab>
The stitch which is a <m>leather</m> rim set on the edge of the knife shape is made to stop the sword frogs.</ab>
 
<ab>
When the small planks are well flattened, the sword is laid down on them and with a <tl>black stone</tl> one marks the width and length of the blade. Then with a <tl>chisel</tl> the excess is cut. And a <tl>plane</tl> is used to even properly following the marks.</ab>
 
<ab>
Then the two small planks are stuck edge to edge <add>and all around</add> only following the knife shape and not elsewhere. And this is to make the scabbard <m>velvet leather</m> hold.</ab>


<ab>
Then the sword is put in the small planks and it is set in the scabbard which is sewed. And they rub what is glued directly on the knife shape with some <m>tallow</m> to run into the scabbard.</ab>
 
<ab>
The scabbard is made of <al>calf</al> or <al>sheep</al> <m>leather</m>, the <al>calf</al> ones are in all one piece, but not the <al>sheep</al> ones. When swords are long, they are made of several patches sewn between <m>leather</m> and <m>flesh</m> and then they rub firmly the stitching with a <m>boxwood</m> piece to cover and even it. From a good <al>calf</al> <m>skin</m>, 8 or  9 or 10 scabbards can be made. A <pro>workman</pro> can easily make 6  a day. If they are too thick, they are lightly thinned out with a plane. If the <m>skin</m> is too hard, it is lightly dipped in some lukewarm <m>water</m> but not for long. Next, the same worker who worked <m>wood</m> piece has to adjust the scabbard in order for it to be well done. It is true that for common people, there are some good already all made, but they never fit perfectly. When the scabbard is made and sewed with black <m>thread</m>, it is rubbed with a <m>boxwood</m> piece or a slightly <m>oiled</m> cloth . The good <al>cow</al> <m>leather</m> scabbard is the best of all and costs also more than all except the <m>velvet</m> ones. Under the <m>velvet</m> one usually put plain <m>canvas</m> or a <al>sheep</al> <m>skin</m> scabbard or a <m>parchment</m> layer. But the best scabbard is a waxed scabbard covered with either <m>velvet</m> or <al>calf</al> <m>skin</m>. One covers the wood with thin canvas, which one then waxes, and covers in <m>velour</m> or <al>calf</al> <m>skin</m>. A <m>waxed</m> scabbard is worth at least 30 cents, a <al>cow</al> leather one, 20 cents. </ab>
