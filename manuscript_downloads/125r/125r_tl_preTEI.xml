<ab>and with your pipes and abrevouers @, you can also place small threads of <m>wax</m> which are applied to the body so that the <m>metal</m> goes more easily from one part to another and runs quickly throughout. And with these pipes, you can guide
your cast and your vents without having ruined anything.</ab>

small rolls, you make your casts and vents without danger of chipping or <x>...</x> any of the mold because the <m>wax</m>, once it has been removed, leaves a thoroughly empty place. Make your vents proceed from the head <x>of the cast</x>, which is at the bottom, towards the cast. Make your cast so that it is not thick, and make two or three notches inside the passage because this impairs the <m>metal</m> fury. And it makes it flow easily without filling with bubbles, <x>and</x> it does not make too much smoke which dams up the passage. You can also divide it into two or three branches thusly

<head><m>Plaster</m></head>


<ab>When you mold something in order to cast with <m>wax</m>, first mold only <m>plaster</m>, you mold with <m>plaster</m> <x>that is</x> only reheated after <x>it</x> has been pulverized. Because, once <x>it</x> has been reheated on the <m>stone</m> slab, the outside is burnt, and the inside remains nearly unburnt. Transparent grey <m>plaster</m> is not strong, but the good one <x><m>plaster</m></x> becomes white once it has been soaked, and <x>it</x> sets well quickly. Nevertheless I have found the grey <x><m>plaster</m></x> to be quite firm and hard after it has set, but it takes longer <x>to work with it</x>. Know the nature of each. You will never mold very neatly if you do not soak until it is quite clear and liquid, your <m>plaster</m> or the core's <m>sand</m>. Soak it straight away after it has been reheated.</ab>
 
<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
However, if you mold with <m>plaster</m> that has been reheated once as said, coat the first mold well with <m>oil</m>. And when the second cast has set and you have prepared it, soak it in <m>water</m> for a long time. And if it does not release, soak it in hot <m>water</m>, because cold <m>water</m> hardens it.</ab>
 
<ab><x>Something</x> to know</ab>


<ab>And hot <m>water</m> softens it <x><m>plaster</m></x> more than cold <m>water</m> <x>which</x> does not penetrate it <x><m>plaster</m></x> as <x>it does</x> <m>mixed</m> <m>plaster</m> because it <x><m>plaster</m></x> is stronger and <m>mixed plaster</m> is spongier. <m>Medal</m>s are cast from this <m>powder</m>ed, reheated <m>plaster</m>, <x>and the <m>medal</m>s</x> will be waterproof as though they were <m>varnish</m>ed. In Germany, people hang these <m>medal</m>s on houses. See to it that the <m>water</m> is very hot, and if the <m>water</m> is boiling, it will not endanger <x>it</x>. All molds <x>made</x> of plaster only or molds <x>made of</x> <m>mixed</m> <m>plaster</m> are stripped from it.</ab>

<head>Scimitars</head>


<ab><pro>Workers</pro> from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate <m>iron</m> from the <m>mine</m>s with <m>steel</m>. And they cast the blades of the scimitar in <m>sand</m> with this first <m>steel</m> <x>that was</x> first casted from its <m>mine</m>. Afterwards, they <x>the blades</x> cut other <m>iron</m> without without great difficulty because all melted <m>iron</m> is harder than soft <m>iron</m> beaten into <x>...</x> and bars. Thus is the <m>steel</m> of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When someone takes the haft of a scimitar off, that person recognizes <x>it</x> well by the tip in the haft which is cast in <m>sand</m>.</ab>

<ab>Make a small hole into the ground, put your ear against it during the night or during an equally quiet time, and you will easily hear the muffled sound.</ab>
