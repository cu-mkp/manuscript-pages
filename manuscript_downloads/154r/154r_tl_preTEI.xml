<head>Removing <m>gold</m></head>


<ab><m>Gold</m> as gilding goes away if the coin is reheated and placed against a strong fire, even if there is <m>lead</m>, because <m>lead</m>, which contains much <m>mercury</m> will pierce a <m>gold</m> coin in a fire.</ab>

<head>Cutting <m>lead</m></head>


<ab>Because it <x><m>lead</m></x> is fat, hard to catch and corrosive to the knife and the scissors, wet it up and you will <x>be able to</x> cut it like <m>glass</m>.</ab>
 
<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
Sometimes, <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m>, exposed to a certain kind of smoke, take on a coloration during the casting. But these are neither flakes nor coat but a colour which will go away during the whitening.</ab>

<head>Softening <m>silver</m></head>


<ab>When <pro>goldsmiths</pro> who work on a large scale have forged their plates, to their loss <x>these plates</x> quite often break and crack because they have been sharpened too much. In order to avoid this, when it is quite melted, throw in ground dry <m>mortar</m> made of <m>sand</m> and good <m>lime</m> which has been used before.</ab>
 
<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
<pro>Goldsmiths</pro> do not work with <m>silver</m> from <m>real</m> because it is rich in <m>lead</m> and becomes sour when forged.</ab>
 
<ab>For small works and things that need to go only once to the fire, some weld with some old <m>sol</m> or <m>carolus</m> reheated and beaten. However if the <m>sol</m> is not quite good <x>enough</x>, the welding will not hold as there is too much <m>copper</m> and one will have to weld twice. Others weld with <x>an alloy made of</x> half <m>silver</m> and half fine <m>copper</m>.</ab>

<ab>Once it is quite ground and refined on the <m>marble</m> slab and mixed with the <m>sand</m> from the core <x>mold</x>, dry it slowing without reheating it, and it will allow for several casting of <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>. <m>Copper</m> and <m>brass</m> come out fine of it. But if it is not ground as finely as <m>crocum</m>, it sinks unless the <m>sand</m> is soaked and quite thick.</ab>

<head><m>Metal file dust</m></head>


<ab>It does not melt by itself if it is not helped with some portion of similar <m>metal</m> melted to assemble it and bathe it, as it is more burnt than melted. <m>File dust</m> from <m>tin</m> and <m>lead</m> are made with <m>tallow</m>, <x><m>file dust</m></x> from <m>gold</m> with <m>saltpeter</m>, <x><m>file dust</m></x> from <m>silver</m> with <m>sandever.</m></ab>
