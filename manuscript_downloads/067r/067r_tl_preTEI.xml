<ab>
daylight, pull out the <m>hairs</m> which make the tip too long with the ends of your fingernails, until the tip appears good to you, &amp; so that you notice in it the <m><al>rat</al> hairs</m> that are entirely black and the <m>hairs of the same <al>squirrel</al></m> that are <del>at the</del> whitish from the root to the middle. When it pleases you, bind and tighten it very well with a thread in two places, then cut what is superfluous &amp;  fit it in a quill of appropriate size, of a <al>duck</al> or a <al>crow</al> for the small ones. Good brushes are those that, once dipped into <m>water</m>, do not bulge when you trace on your hand.</ab>

<ab>All <m>oil</m> which is imbibed by <m>paper</m> &amp; once heated by fire evaporates  &amp; leaves the <m>paper</m> clean, like <m>turpentine</m> &amp; <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m>, is good for making <m>varnish</m>.</ab>

<ab>Before you put in the <m>metal</m>,  it is necessary that it be red at the bottom, like like a <m>charcoal</m> &amp; well inflamed. Next, you <del><ill/></del> fill it &amp; cover the <m>charcoal</m> &amp; adjust the <tl>bellows</tl>, otherwise the <m>metal</m> on top would melt as a result of the <tl>bellows</tl> &amp; its bottom would be curdled &amp; cooled &amp; would not run. But if you proceed in this manner you will melt everything you like.</ab>

<ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> make boxes <del>p</del> covered with painted <m>paper</m> &amp; varnish it with <m>glair of the egg</m> mixed with <m>gum</m> &amp; a little <m><m>oil</m>, not of <m><pa>spike lavender</pa></m>, but another <sn>odorant</sn> that resembles <m><pa>olive</pa> oil</m></m>. Every work done with <m>glair</m> supports <m>oil</m>. It is with this that <pro>painters</pro> trick the <pro>poor peasants</pro>, painting their bands of <m>taffeta</m> with this <m>glair</m>, to be done sooner. But <env>the first rain</env> carries away everything.</ab>
