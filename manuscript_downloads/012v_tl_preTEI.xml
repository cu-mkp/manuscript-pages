However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the above mentioned thing, <m>enilanroc</m>, in a small <m>iron</m> casket on the fire of my <pro>goldsmith</pro>'s forge with three or four small half-burnt <m>coals</m> and blew on it only with my mouth. However, the thing caught fire and became all white, not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the fire, since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all white, I passed it through my <m>lead</m> wheel and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And after scraping off a little of the white, I found it to be of a clear fleshy tone. Finally, I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could compare with a quite beautiful <m>agate</m> for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful face and applying it to a table of<lb/>
