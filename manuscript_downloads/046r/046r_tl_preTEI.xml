<head><m>Oil of sulfur</m> for the teeth</head>
<ab>Some people whiten them with compositions of <m><fr>eau forte</fr></m>, however one says that this corrupts them afterwards and causes them to blacken. One says that <m>oil of sulfur</m> is excellent, but it needs to be applied in this way: take as much <m>clove oil</m> as can be held in a <m>nutshell</m>, as much <m>rose honey</m>, and seven or eight drops of <m>oil of sulfur</m>, and put it all together, and after having cleaned the teeth with a small burin, touch them lightly with a <del>good</del> bit of <m>cotton</m> dipped in the aforementioned oils and leave it for a little while, then spit it out or rinse the mouth with tepid water, and repeat two or three times. <m>Oil of sulfur</m> penetrates and is corrosive, <del>and l</del> but the <m>clove oil</m> and the <m>rose honey</m> correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.</ab>
