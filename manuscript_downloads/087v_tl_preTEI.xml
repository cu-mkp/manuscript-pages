<ab><m>Sand</m>, when overheated, does not hold as well. <m>Slate</m> is baked and will mold clean, yet it is true that often it becomes porous, just like burned <m>earth</m> also does, as well as any kind of greasy <m>sand</m>.</ab>

I find that one should not hammer on <m>sand</m> [already] very finely pulverised, because it would damage it, and then [the <m>sand</m>] wouldn’t be able to release the cast cleanly. Still, one must press it hard, and moisten it sufficiently.</note>

<ab><pro>Founders</pro> harvest the <m>roots of a young elm</m> when it is sappy, and boil it in <m>wine</m>, or better yet <m>vinegar</m>. They prepare a year’s worth of it and store it in a cask.</ab>

<head><m>Sand</m> from sand pit from Toulouse</head>


<ab>[In order to use] <m>sand</m> from a sandpit for casting, filter it through a double sieve, then having mixed it with molten <m>resin</m> it burns and heats, and becomes all red and hot as iron. Once it has cooled down it is completely black and can be pulverised on <m>porphyry</m> very well. Having prepared it like this and checked the smoothness of the surface with my nail, I moistened it with <m>egg white</m> and beat it vigorously, until it was not a paste anymore but a powder. I found [this <m>sand</m>] to release the cast very well, and molded very clean in <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m> [with it], however it needs to be baked long enough and slowly.</ab>


<ab>Others beat it strongly in a mortar, in small amounts at a time, thus it sacache and comes out very fine; then they bake it moderately, just enough to dry it, and then they crush it dry on <m>porphyry</m>. Thus it is made almost impalpable, and yet not too dry, and it retains the consistency and the binding quality of the <m>earth</m> to which it is related, and is better than when it is burnt. When you moisten it with <m>egg white</m> and pass it through a <m>sponge</m> it releases very clean for a low relief, but not a figure in high relief. Considering this, since then I experimented with moistening it only with strong <m>vinegar</m>. [That way] it releases a figure I previously had not been able to release [from the mold]. I think that even when you wet the finest sort with <m>egg white</m>, or in a similar fashion, or the thick sort pour remplir de chasses with <m>water</m>, <m>salt</m>, or <m>vinegar</m>, they do not mix so well. However, given that they are of one and the same nature, and are similarly moistened, they espouse each other, and hold together.</ab>

To mold well, when your <m>sands</m> are prepared, mold in one day. Bake slowly the next day, then cast the other.</ab>


<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
Choose [<m>sand</m>] that comes in clods and lumps, and deep down in the earth, because commonly the one near the surface is too much akin to earth, whereas the deep one is similar to rock.</note>

<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
I have sometimes molded with <m>pure lead</m> cast very hot, and the example as well as the principal were very clean, but since the <m>vinegar</m> gives it little binding, it held only for one cast.</note></root>
