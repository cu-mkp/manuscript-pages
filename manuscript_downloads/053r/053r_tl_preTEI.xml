<head>Soldering a vise</head>


<ab>It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high for use in making a long piece, and that they join well to clamp a thin object. In order to solder the nut, after you have made the bolt, you will make a long <m>iron</m> strip of the right thickness to fit into the notch of the bolt when red hot, and you will bend it all around <x>the bolt</x> by striking it with a hammer. Once it is well wrapped around, you will insert the bolt around which the nut is wrapped.</ab>

<ab>If, in the fire &amp;melting, it touches the <m>iron</m>, this <m>iron</m> will be afterwards so brittle that it will be able to be forged.</ab>

<head><m>Lead</m> casting</head>


<ab>One mixes it, according to some, with <ms>half</ms> <m>tin</m> &amp; <ms>half</ms> <m>lead</m> and, to <add>heat</add> <del><ill/></del> it, one mixes in a little <m>sublimate</m>. It casts well in small sizes in a <m><al>cuttlefish</al> bone</m>, provided it is good.</ab>

<head><m>Paper</m> molding</head>


<ab>Boil <add>over hot <m>ashes</m></add> some <m>cotton</m> in <m><la>aqua fortis</la></m> mixed with <m>sal ammoniac</m>, like <m><la>aqua regia</la></m>, and the <m>cotton</m> will become very fine, like powder. Mix it next it with <m>gummed water</m> &amp; you will cast very delicately.</ab>

<head>Almond trees, apricot trees</head>


<ab>They grow quite straight if they are grafted. And every kind of tree <x>whose fruit has</x> pits, such as nectarines, peaches, clingstone-peaches, apricots etc., comes best by shield budding on an almond tree by.</ab>

<head><m>Lead</m> and <m>copper</m> casting</head>


<ab><m>Lead</m> &amp; <m>tin</m> come out well in <m>white chalk</m> but the softer it is the better. The one from <pl>Champaigne</pl> reaches the price that is fixed in <pl>Lyon</pl>. <m>Burnt &amp; calcined <al>horse</al> bones</m> mold very neatly.</ab>
 
<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
I believe that the <m>marrow from the horns of <al>oxen</al></m> or <m><al>sheep</al></m>, that is to say, the <m>spongy bone</m> from the inside, molds very neatly and is better than <m>bone</m>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>bottom</margin>
Note that all <m>brittle metal comes out better than fat</m> ones. Also, <m>lean sand</m> receives it better &amp; absorbs it rather than the <m>dense one</m>.</ab>
