<head>Casting</head>


<ab>
<m>Tin</m> recoils if thick, therefore it is better to cast it thin and from one piece, to make two and then solder them together, if necessary. One makes use of a strong piece of <m>taffeta</m> to sieve the fine sand with which one first covers the medal, which is of the thickness of a teston.</ab>

<ab>
Mix some <m>vinegar</m> with a bit of <m>bile</m>, put it into a <m>glass</m> bottle, and if you want to preserve it for a long time, add some <m>salt</m> and mix some of this with your colors which will make them flow.</ab>

<ab>
If you take enough with the tip of an ear picker and you sieve it with foam of <m>urine</m>, which often forms in <sup>the <m>urine</m></sup> of  those who have a headache, all the foam will dissipate.</ab>

<ab>
To well recognize their difference and their true color by candlelight, it is necessary to put the candle behind a <m>crystal</m> mirror, or a <m>glass</m> globe or jar full of <m>water</m>, because this light is like sunlight.</ab>
