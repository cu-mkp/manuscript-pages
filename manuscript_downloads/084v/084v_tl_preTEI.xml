<ab>I tried the <m>bone of oxen <add>feet</add></m>, very burned &amp; pulverized &amp; ground on <m>porphyry</m>, until it is not felt between your fingers. It molds on its own very neatly. But because on its own it is very arid &amp; lean, it wants to be well moistened &amp; dampened with wine boiled with elm root.</ab>


<ab><m>Iron dross</m>, well burned <m>bone of oxen feet</m>, <m>felt</m> also well burned over a closed fire, and all three very well ground on <m>porphyry</m> mold very neatly in <m>lead</m>, without needing to be reheated a lot, &amp; casting <del>le</del>in a hot or cold frame.</ab>


<ab><m>Felt</m> alone molds very neatly once moistened &amp; releases well, and also makes the other two release.</ab>

These <m>sands</m> only withstand one casting.</ab>

A fat <m>sand</m> which is rendered very smooth, makes it porous.</ab>

<ab>Some people think that <m>salt water</m> is not good, because the <m>salt</m> cracks in  fire, &amp; consequently should make it porous. a result causes bubbles. There is only <m>wine</m> boiled with <m>elm root</m>.</ab>
 
<ab><m>Charcoal</m> for <fr>poncer</fr> makes for a good release, but one finds the one of willow make it porous. The one of <m>oak</m> or <m>beech</m> does well without making it porous.</ab>

<ab>For casting, there is only <m>soft lead</m> that wants to be cast very <del>g</del> hot, and <m>soft tin</m>.</ab>

<ab> I took <m>ceruse</m> and crushed it dry on <m>porphyry</m>, to make it very fine, then I moistened so much, with well beaten <m>egg <fr>glaire</fr></m>, that it was like a paste, smoothing it perfectly with the dull side of a knife. I left it a little. </ab>

One ought to mix it well with a knife.</ab>
