<ab>When <sup><al>a snake</al></sup> has eaten something; when tormenting it, it will vomit <sup>the food</sup>. And if, after having eaten something, <sup>the snake</sup> is pressed underfoot, this troubles <sup>the snake</sup> a lot and makes it sick. If <sup>the snake</sup> is wounded, it will not eat voluntarily.</ab></div>

<head><tl>Molds</tl></head>


<ab>There is nothing better for opening them up than to oil them with <m>olive oil</m>, and nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to separate them, soak them in cold <m>water</m>; that is the secret. And you will see that the <m>oil</m><m>,</m> although it seems to be imbued, will separate itself <sup>from the water</sup> as <sup>does</sup> grease. <al>Mussels</al> become stronger in cold <m>water</m>, and warm <m>water</m> would dissolve them with difficulty, although having been reheated, <sup>the mussels</sup> are <sup>then</sup> more handleable and easy to dissolve in the <m>water</m>.</ab></div>

<head><m>Wheat oil</m></head>


<ab>Is made on a blade of <m>iron</m> reddened in the fire, and the <m>oil</m> turns into drops, which is appropriate to oil the hair of a butterfly or similar thing, because this <m>oil</m> is instantly dry and makes the rest dry out.  It is necessary that the coat or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, because <sup>if left</sup> standing up, it will make the sand raise up and form bubbles.</ab>
 
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin><figure>#</figure> If you want to mold something delicate, like a pansy, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with <m>butter</m>.  But it is best to oil it with <m>wheat oil</m> because it has no opacity and does not block the smaller features as much, and makes the flower firmer.</ab></div>

<head>A cast of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m></head>


<ab>Because you want to cast <m>tin</m> very thinly, if your medal, plant or other thing <sup>you want</sup> to mold is thin and fine, make <sup>sure</sup> to include more <m>tin</m>, much more than <m>lead</m>, namely less than the fourth part of <m>lead</m> for three of <m>tin</m>. And moreover, one only puts <m>lead</m> in as an alloy. Contrarily, if you want to mold something strong and thick, put a lot more <m>lead</m> in than <m>tin</m>. And for the one and the other you can put in a little <m>looking-glass tin</m>, but only a very little, with a little <m>resin</m>, when you want to cast.  Since then, when molding with pure new <m>lead</m>, I put in two ounces of pure <m>tin</m> for every pound <sup>of <m>lead</m></sup>.  And when molding with pure <m>tin</m>, I put in two ounces of pure <m>lead</m> for every pound <sup>of <m>tin</m></sup>. I made some plants and snakes as if they were real.</ab>
 
<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>
I cast <m>tin</m> <sup>when it was</sup> nearly red, and the same thing with <m>lead</m>, which however had not remained in the fire for too long, because it becomes brittle and burns up.</ab>
