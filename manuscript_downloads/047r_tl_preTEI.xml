<ab>Those from <me>Bayonne</m>, which seem to be made of <m>grès</m>, are better because they last, without comparison, longer than others. And since they are not very thick, one wastes less <m>charcoal</m> to melt <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> because they are quickly heated. They do not absorb <m>silver</m> as much as others, and for this reason, there is not much laveure to be found in them. They are also not as likely to fall over as others that have a flat foot.
