<ab><m>Acetum</m> paratum ex <m>ruta</m> <m>baccis juniperi</m> simul tusis Eo<lb/><m>aceto</m> extinguantur <m>lateres</m> igniti. Et vapor excipiatur ore [&amp;]<lb/>naribus.  <m>Rue</m> <m>vinegar</m> together with crushed <m>juniper berries</m>. Pour the <m>vinegar</m> over red hot <m>bricks</m> and inhale the vapor through the mouth and nostrils. This is to preserve oneself when going into noxious air: a garment can be perfumed with this vapor in order to remove infection from a room, house, etc. And if you find yourself in a place where you do not have this preparation, carry <m>rue</m> and <m>berries</m> crushed together, then, if need be, boil them in <m>vinegar</m> and use as described.</ab>
