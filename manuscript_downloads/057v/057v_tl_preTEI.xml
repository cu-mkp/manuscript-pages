<ab><pro>Tanners</pro>use small <m>skins</m> of <al>lambs</al> and young <al>goats</al>
nearly as delicate as <m>parchments</m> and they keep them in some humid places and keep wetting them. When they want to print some stories on it they lay them in their molding hollows of their figure and then on top they spread some greasy fine <m>earth</m> used for trimming <m>wool</m> fabrics, well pressed and beaten and slightly humid and soft and then put on the <m>earth</m> a small  one-piece board and put the whole under a press and leave that dry there. After the <m>earth</m> the <m>leather</m> only remains very neatly printed [missing word] of the size of a pea. And then apply on the <m>leather</m> two or three <m>black copperas</m> and <m>iron scale</m> layers one after the other like the <pro>tanners</pro> do. And since this tincture is astringent and shrinks the leather will be stronger more more easily printable. Once dried stick on the reverse some <m>fabric</m> with strong <m>glue</m>, and by doing so one can quickly imitate big statues and very fine medals and paint them and [illegible] and are light and can be carried and last for a long time. What can be printed on a relief can be made differently and can be reheated with a hot <m>iron</m> tool.</ab></div>

<ab>Good <m>crayons</m> are not made with <m>glue</m> but with <m>women's milk</m>.</ab>


<ab>Images made of <m>card</m> have to be dipped in some very fine and clarified melted <m>rosin</m> once they have dried. This strengthens them or they will turn flaccid in wet weather.</ab>


<ab><pl>Venice</pl> masks are made with a molding hollow and the face covered with <m>copper</m>.</ab>


<ab>The <pl>Flemish</pl> do not use other white colors for <m>oil</m> painted skin colors after some <m>white lead</m> for the <m>ceruse</m> turns them yellow.</ab>


<ab>The 4 or 5 years old and clear <m>nut oil</m> is the best anti-dust color. The one slowly squeezed from the press similar to <m>almond oil</m> is white even if the <m>nuts' skin</m> is peeled off.</ab>
