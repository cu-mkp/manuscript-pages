<ab>Those which are found in the ocean and similarly those in which certain small crayfish dwell are very beautiful for grottoes, if they have been rid of the first layer of their shell with <m>aqua fortis</m>, because they really look to be made of mother-of-pearl.</ab>

<head>For removing flaws and whiskers from things molded in a core mold</head>


<ab>If your molds are made of good <m>plaster</m> which withstands <m>fire</m>, they will not crack, especially if they are squeezed well between two tables with presses or in a pot filled with <m>ash</m>es or <m>sand</m>, and, therefore, they will not develop flaws. If they they develop some [flaws[, you can remove them with a burin called "chaple," which has a tip like a small chisel.</ab>

<head>For grottoes</head>


<ab><m>Stone</m>s made from water called <m>stuf</m>. <m>Charcoal</m>, the work of <m>tin</m>, and pure <m>brass</m>. <m>Paper</m> ground up and mixed with ground up <m>glass</m>. <m>Cork</m>. <m>Heated parchment</m>, <m>white coral</m>. All of them are appropriate for making grottoes. But, once dry, bizarre pieces of <m>wood</m>, which [the bizarre pieces of wood] are found in the forests and among [regular] mushrooms and large mushrooms [growing on] trees, are better than all of them because they are light. Mix in with small pieces of <m>looking-glass tin</m> which have a shiny luster. Grind in a little of a different kind of <m>marcasite</m> in order to clean the <m>earth</m> away, then powder the work, which is very beautiful. If there is no spring in the grotto, glue all of this with strong <m>glue</m>, and then the work is done. You must show all kinds of <m>mines</m>. The <m>sulfur</m>ous <m>marcasites</m> which do not have a grain but are even like <m>looking-glass tin</m> are very beautiful.</ab>

<ab>If one ounce of [<m>looking-glass tin</m>] is put in with it [pure <m>tin</m>], pure <m>tin</m> whitens and becomes firm, that is, I ℥ of <m>looking-glass tin</m> in one lb of pure <m>tin</m>.</ab>
