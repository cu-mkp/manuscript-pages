<ab>To become an artist, it is necessary to draw by eye, without compass or ruler. Masters do not allow apprentices to use them.</ab>


<ab>When the priming has been done a long while ago, it becomes greasy. It must be scrubbed with <m>ashes</m> and <m>water</m>.</ab>

<head>Perspective</head> 


<ab>In order to tell where the <sup>vanishing</sup> point is one must lay a ruler over the lines, and the point will be where the lines meet. Some make a hole at the end of their rulers in order to fix the point by that hole while moving the ruler about. Others lay a ruler across the panel,, then on this ruler they place the tip of another ruler which, being attached to the former by a screw, will move about and reach as far as necessary without losing the point. The ruler and compass without discernment of the eye will cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.</ab>

To paint a perspective in oil, you should not use a ruler, for you would smudge everything. Instead, in applying your colors you must keep and follow the lines of your first drawing.</ab>

<ab>Also, to make plumb lines, that is lines from the top to the bottom of the panel, you need to have a thread with a piece of <m>lead</m> attached to one end and a little hook to the other end for hanging the said thread from the top of the painting.</ab>

<ab>In order to draw and to apply the colors, especially in <m>oil</m>, you must keep your panel as straight as possible on the easel, since if it is tilted there is a danger that dust or impurities might stick on it. Keep the place where you paint clean and free of dust.</ab>
