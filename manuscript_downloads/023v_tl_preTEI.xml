powder. When the saucisson is completely filled, dip it gently in two parts <m>vinegar</m> and one of spirits</m>, to moisten the <m>cloth</m> but not the powder. After, leave the aforesaid <m>cloth</m> to dry completely, and then you must attach to the saucisson a long string or cord twice as long as the saucisson, but you must not tie it to the saucisson but make it touch the two ends and sew it to the saucisson in a few places in the middle. After you must smear all of the saucisson with very good <m>turpentine</m>, and at one end, where you want to sew the mortar's fuse for carrying the fire, you can sew or attach with a strong knot a selvage of <m>cloth</m> as large as one span which will also be well soaked in <m>turpentine</m>, and this selvage should be cut in the middle so that it can be fastened and wrapped around the mortar, and you must attach it so that the tip of the saucisson that is open will be joined to the fuse of the mortar. Then you must place a lot of tightly-packed powder onto the fuse of the mortar. And after, the person outside of the ditch must draw the small line and cord that is joined to the saucisson so that it is extended mid-way, but not so much that it is detached. And if there is water in the ditch, it will be necessary to support the saucisson with a musket-rest. Then, having placed himself and others in safety, the person who holds the tip of the saucisson will be able to carry the fire.</ab>

It is necessary that the canonball be round on one side and flat on the other like a half of a cut cannonball. It is also necessary that the cross holds itself to the ball and that it (the ball melting itself if it is made with metal) is enveloped with the middle of the cross.</ab>
