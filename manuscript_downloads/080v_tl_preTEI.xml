<head><pro>Founders</pro> of small <m>tin</m> work</head>


<ab>They usually cast from <m>soft</m> <m>solder</m> the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine and <m>soft</m> <m>tin</m>. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include <m>glass tin</m> in them, just like they mix a little [<m>glass tin</m>] in the <m>soft tin</m>. They carve their work on <m>stones</m> of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great flakes near the mountains, and resemble slate. You can find these [<m>rocks</m>] in three colors: one <m>reddish</m>, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain <m>heat</m>; [another] one is <m>the color of dark slate</m>, and the other is <m>whitish</m>. When they work a relief, first they print it on <m>paper maché</m>, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planning their <m>stones</m> and rubbing them together, they use a compass or little <m>iron tools</m> to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four <m>stones</m>, to make a circle or a square with the <m>stones</m> which join perfectly because the <m>stones</m> are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with <m>tallow</m>, and it [the mould] absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having [put] fine powder of <m>quicklime</m> into a cloth, they rub the mould using <m>pounce</m> in beating the <m>linen</m> on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles [from forming]. The main thing is that you make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown [on the picture]. They make a hole in the medal, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the medal. <figure/>And if they want their work to last, they pierce [it] somewhere and fit in a piece of <m>cork.</m> <m>Lead</m> or <m>tin</m> will not damage it. </ab>

Make sure the pegs of your frame fit in easily so it will open with ease without moving anything else. Your <m>tin box molds</m> should fit well, and the table should be very flat. </ab>

Try to carve with <m>distilled vinegar</m>.</ab>

Try calcined <m>oyster shells</m>; they are said to be excellent for molding.</ab>
