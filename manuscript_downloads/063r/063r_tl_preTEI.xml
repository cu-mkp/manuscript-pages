<ab>Although it is said to be immortal, <m>white wine</m> removes its coloration and makes it light red and the dried <m>flower</m> ends up white. Note that <m>wine</m> does so, and I have tried it. <m>Spirits</m> have the same effect.</ab>

<head>Drying of <m>oil</m></head>


<ab>If the <m>oil</m> does not dry, put in <m>massicot</m> and <m>minium</m>. There is no better <m>oil</m> than <m>walnut oil</m>, because it does not dry out too quickly nor too slowly.</ab>

<head>Casting</head>


<ab>The <pl>Germans</pl> use <m>lead from <pl>Flanders</pl></m> because it is very soft.  And to cast better they take <m>lead ore</m> &amp; melt it, &amp; separate what is melted from the from the <m>filth</m> &amp; <m>ore</m>, &amp; pour it into a separate <tl>vessel</tl>, then <del>the bottom</del> they cast with it. For the <m>lead</m> must not have been used in works before, but rather completely new. Some cast into <tl>molds of <m>iron</m> &amp; <m>copper</m></tl>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
or new <m>lead</m> coming from the <env>mine</env>. They melt it twice in a <tl>crucible</tl>. In the first one, they cleanse it of <m>filth</m>. In the second, they <del>en</del> cast.</ab>

<head><m>Verdigris</m> and another very beautiful, gay green</head>


<ab>One must not crush it with <m>water</m> alone, because that makes it fade. To make it beautiful in distemper, some crush it with <m>vinegar</m>, but that makes it turn pale and become whitish. To make it beautiful, crush it with <m>urine</m> and leave it to dry. Then, whenever you like, crush it with <m>oil</m>. And after you have collected it with the palette, before you finish cleaning the <m>marble</m>, crush it <sup>there</sup> with <m>stil de grain yellow</m>. And you will have a very beautiful green.</ab>
