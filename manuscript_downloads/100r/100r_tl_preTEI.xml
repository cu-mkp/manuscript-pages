<ab>To very quickly make a layer of <fr><m>or <del>sur</del>mat</m></fr> on <m>canvas</m> or on other <m>oil</m> panel, one <x>exposes</x> <m><pa>walnut</pa> oil</m> under the sun or on the fire to make it fatty, as previously mentioned, for it thickens by itself in this way, despite having neither <m>lead</m>, nor <m>ceruse</m>. And with it, crush <fr><m>massicot</m></fr>, <m>mine</m>, &amp; other desiccants, but not <fr><m>vert-de-gris</m></fr> nor <m>orpiment</m>, for they make the <m>gold</m> die. It will quickly be dry. However, if the weather is not <fr>serain</fr> and dry, do not shade it, for if the weather is dewy &amp; humid, it will turn black.</ab>

<ab>One must carefully <sn>observe </sn>the <bp>eyes</bp>, the <bp>nose</bp>, and the <bp>beard</bp>, since these three things contribute much to the resemblance.</ab>

<ab>Your materials need to be pounded in a thick <m>glass</m> <tl>mortar</tl> coated with <m>mastic</m> &amp; encased into another <m>wooden</m> <tl>mortar</tl>, so that it does not break; this can be useful to <pro>perfumers</pro>. &amp; use a <m>glass</m> <tl>pestle</tl> too.</ab>

<head>Vitrified <m>saltpeter</m></head>


<ab>
Melted with <m>pebbles</m>, it makes the <m>glass</m> very white. But rather, it needs to be calcined on a hot tile or <tl>paddle</tl>. And mix the liquid remains of the vapor with as much white, calcined <m>pebbles</m>. It is true that, in the little <tl>oven</tl>, it does not make it very clear. But for big windows, it makes the <m>glass</m> very clear, &amp; white &amp; clean.</ab>

<head>Windows through which the sun will not pass</head>


<ab>Take the aforementioned calcined <m>saltpeter</m> &amp; expose it to a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the sun will not pass through; rather, it will cast shade. One needs to put the <m>saltpeter</m> on any clean place, &amp; put glowing <m>coals</m> on it, and continue all over until it no longer burns.</ab>

It also serves for melting &amp;for adding in with <m>alkali salt</m> for cleaning <bp>hands</bp>.</ab>
