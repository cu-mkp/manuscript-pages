<head>Molding very thin like<pro>bimbalotiers</pro> do</head>


<ab>They mould in <m>paper</m> or <m>cardboard</m>, because neither sandy <m>earth</m> nor <m>metal</m> would mold so neatly and would not receive.  Or they engrave with <m>stone</m> from <pl>Istre</pl>, for the main side, and the reverse is in <m>paper</m> or <m>cardboard</m>.</ab>

<head>Reducing a round form into a hollow one</head>


<ab>You must firstly mold it with <m>plaster</m> as has been said before, and in the <m>plaster</m> throw in some <m>wax</m> from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure.  Then you will mold this <m>wax</m> relief once more in <m>plaster</m>, or even better with your tempered sand, <figure>#</figure>, as if for a noyau.  And in the latter throw in some <m>lead</m> and from this you will have a very neat relief, and if it is not, repair it on <m>cement</m> or a similar material, and beware that it should always release well.  And this one will always serve you as a model for making as many hollow molds as you would like.  In this way, place half of your <m>lead</m> figure which you have <m>oiled</m>, and moisten it with <m>spirits</m> as we have seen above, on your <m>clay</m> base, then mold this half with a <m>white plaster</m>.  Having taken hold, and having smoothed and flattened the <m>plaster</m>, take your <m>black wax</m> mixed with <m>sulphur</m> as we have seen before, because it leaves nothing in the mold and melts quicker.  Dip it in hot <m>urine</m>, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your half figure in <m>lead</m>.  And you will have a very neat hollow mold.  Then adapt your <m>wax</m> hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow <m>wax</m>; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in <m>wax</m> or <m>metal</m> in a noyau.  And the noyau mold will give you, whether in <m>silver</m> or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the <m>wax</m> one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other.  And having cleaned this hollow, and having put it in the <m>bleach</m>, if it is made of <m>silver</m>, you can put into it some <m>sugar</m> work</ab>


<ab><margin>left-top</margin>Having made a hole in your <m>clay</m> base and having placed there your half figure in <m>wax</m>, <m>oil</m> it a bit so that it comes out more easily.</ab>
 
<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>Transparent <m>wax</m> is not good as opposed to one that has body, for making good imprints.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>Because you have molded one of your halves with <m>plaster</m> and <m>wax</m>, you can do the same thing to the other half.</ab>
