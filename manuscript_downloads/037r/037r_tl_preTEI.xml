<ab>The <m>metal</m> whitens the more it is melted, because the <m>tin</m> does not go away but rather mixes in more. And, by holding it a long time in the fire, the <m>filth</m> is eaten away, which makes it brittle. If you want to chase away the <m>tin</m> from the <m>copper</m>, after it is well hot, throw in <m>saltpeter</m> often. This only &amp; not the fire separates it, &amp; purifies it, &amp; eats the <m>filth</m> away. The <m>metal</m> is cast very neatly. The <m>copper</m> is prone to swell, but because it is soft, it can be fixed with a <tl>hammer</tl>.</ab>

<head>Medicine for the stomach which warms it <x>stomach</x> and unstops the liver</head>
<ab>Have some <m>wormwood powder</m>, dissolve it in some <m>capilli veneris syrup</m> or <m>preserves</m>, and make an opiate that you will take once a week on a piece of <m>bread</m> dipped in <m>wine</m>. Then you will be able to drink a bit of fully dipped <m>wine</m>. This clears the phlegm and gas which come from there. You can take six <m>pepper</m> grains, and grate their <m>rinds</m> so they are smooth, and swallow them without chewing them. This heals the stomach without warming the liver.</ab>

<head>For preventing candles from dripping and making them <x>candles</x> white</head>
<ab>Once they have been made, put in a mould some fresh <m>water</m> whipped with some <m>bran</m>, which should by no means be purged again of its <m>flour</m>, so that the <m>water</m> is white. And dip your candles in this. Then leave them to dry. And do so thusly two or three times.</ab>
