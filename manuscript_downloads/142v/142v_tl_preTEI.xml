<head>Molding <al>grasshoppers</al> and things too thin</head>
 
<ab>If you have to mold a piece of written-on <m>paper</m> that is too thin, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your <m>paper</m> with melted <m>butter</m>, which is the most appropriate means there is, &amp; for strengthening the wings of either a <al>butterfly</al> or a <al>grasshopper</al>, or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted <m>butter</m> under the wing or in whichever place it will not be seen.  For giving thickness to a pansy or other flowers, <m>butter</m> is not good, but rather <m>wheat oil</m>, which is soon dry &amp; holds firm.  <m>Wax</m> would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract.  But <m>butter</m> is amiable and handleable.</ab>
 
<ab><margin>left-top</margin>If you write on <m>paper</m> or on common <m>carton</m> and your letters are made with <m>gum</m>, the moisture of the <m>clay</m> plate (?) or the wet (?) sand for a noyau will moisten your letters <sup>and</sup> undo them.  Write therefore with <m>cinnabar</m> mixed with <m>oil</m>, on oiled &amp; stamped (?) <m>paper</m>.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin><figure>+</figure>Reheat your molds with <m>charcoal</m> firstly lit in the forge, so that the fire is not too hot and does not break the molds.  And do not fire as strongly where the mold is thin as where it is thick.</ab>

<head>Molds</head>


<ab>Make some notches in them <sup>the molds</sup> that enter more into the inside of the mold than the outside because in this way, they have more strength.  Take care to keep from reheating them suddenly in a burning hot fire, because this will make them break.</ab>


<ab><margin>right-middle</margin>Do not keep them <sup>molds</sup> in a humid place, nor an enclosed place if they are not well dry, because they will mold.  The same with dried animals.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-middle</margin>It is not at all necessary to reheat the molds two times when the animal can pull away without burning, as do <al>toads</al>, which can very well be molded hollow like all thick animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold once.</ab>

<head><m>Lute</m> for <m>luting</m> your molds</head>


<ab>I have not found a <sup>lute</sup> that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the lean <m>earth</m> that <pro>artillery founders</pro> and <pro>bell founders</pro> use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy.  Soak it moderately like a very thick <m>mortar</m>. Mix into it about one half of <m>horse manure</m> and then beat it well.  Afterwards mix in one third of <m>cloth waste</m> or <m>cloth shavings</m> and beat it again quite strongly.  You can reheat your mold as soon as the <m>lute</m> is ready.</ab>
