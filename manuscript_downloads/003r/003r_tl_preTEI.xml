<head>Imitation coral</head>

<ab>One must first make the branches from <m>wood</m> or take a fantastical <m>thorn branch</m>, then melt a pound of the best possible <m>clear</m> <m>pine resin</m> and add one ounce of finely ground <m>vermilion</m> together with <m>walnut oil,</m> and if you add a little <m>Venice</m> <m>lake</m> the color will be all the more vivid, and stir all together into the <m>resin,</m> molten over a <m>charcoal</m> fire, not over an open flame, lest it catch fire. Then dip in your branches with a swirling motion. And should there remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the <m>charcoal</m>.</ab>

<m>Colophony</m> is nothing other than <m>resin</m> that has been cooked again. To do it well, you take a <m>leaded</m> <tl>pot</tl> and melt the <m>resin</m>, boiling it over the brazier for a good hour until it appears not thick but clear and liquid like <m>water</m> and it easily runs as a thread off the end of a stick, which you use to crush and test it. Then pour it through a coarse <m>canvas</m> or <m>tammy cloth</m> so that it falls into the strongest <m>vinegar</m> you can find, because the <m>vinegar</m> makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified. To imitate your <m>coral</m>, you can mix a fourth part of <m>mastic</m> with your purified <m>resin</m> to make it more solid and finer, and if you should use just one drop of <m>mastic</m>, it would be all the better, but it would take too long.

<m>Sulfur</m> and <m>vermilion</m> have the same effect.</ab>

<m>Coral</m> made of <m>red enamel</m> withstands filing and polishing.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>right-top</margin>
It is made like <m>cement</m>, which is stronger when mixed with crushed <m>glass</m> rather than with <m>brick</m>. In the same way, together with the <m>vermilion</m>, one mixes in <m>opaque red enamel</m>, finely ground. It is the same way with all <m>enamel</m> colors.</ab>

<head><m>Varnish</m> for panels</head>


<ab>Take a <ms>lb</ms> of <m><pl>Venice</pl> turpentine</m> &amp; heat it in a <tl>pot</tl> until it simmers, and put in half a <ms>lb</ms> of the <m>turpentine oil</m> of the whitest you can find, and stir it all together well on a <m>charcoal</m> fire and take it off immediately. And <del><fr>elle</fr></del> it is done. But if it seems too thick to you, add in a little more <m>oil</m>. Similarly if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <m>turpentine</m>. Thus you will give it whatever body you want. It could be made well without fire, but, when heated, it is more desiccative. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things without distorting the colors or yellowing. And it dries both <env>in the shade</env> and <env>in the sun</env>, and <tmp>overnight</tmp>, and <tmp>during the winter</tmp> as well as <tmp>in the summer</tmp>. It is usually sold 15 <cn>sols</cn> a <ms>lb</ms>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
A little more <m>turpentine</m> than <m>turpentine oil</m> is needed in order to give body to the <m>varnish</m>, which needs to be applied with <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> in order to spread it thinner and less thick, for when it is thick, it turns yellow and sticks. One does not <m>varnish</m> to make paintings shine, for it just takes the light out of them.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>bottom</margin>
But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. <m>Mastic varnish</m> does not resist <env>rain</env>, whereas that of <m>oil</m> and <m>rosin</m> does.</ab>

<head><m>Thick varnish</m> for floorboards</head>
 
<ab>There is a <m>varnish</m> that takes a long time to dry &amp; still drips up to two <tmp>months</tmp> after it has been applied to the floorboards. But this one does not drip like the one used <tmp>in the past</tmp>, which was made of <m>linseed oil</m> boiled with <m>garlic</m>, to extinguish it &amp; take out the fattiness, &amp; with <m>wheat</m>. And this one yellowed &amp; made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like the other one except that one puts <m>common thick turpentine</m></ab>
