<head>Molding fruits and animals in sugar</head>


<ab><m>Sugar</m> is fatty, and, with it, round things and large muscles are cast well but fine and delicate things [are cast with] difficulty. However, try well-purified <m>sugar</m>. The <m>plaster</m> mold must be soaked in <m>water</m> for a full night or a full day before casting <m>sugar</m> so that it [the mold] is saturated with <m>water</m> and does not soak up the <m>syrup</m> [the <m>sugar</m> mixture]. The [plaster] mold must also be stripped very well from it [the sugar], because <m>sugar</m> is aigre and brittle. Thus, do not cast anything with <m>sugar</m> which is not stripped easily from it, and which can not be neatly molded in two parts to open as will be needed. If you want to mold a grape, you must get it when it is very fresh; because if it is withered, it [the cast] will look the same. See to it, thus, that you make your molds in the natural season for each thing [fruit]. Grapes that one wants to cast in <m>sugar</m> are man-made, either with <m>wax</m> or <m>earth</m> or with grapes molded with melted <m>wax</m>, on some dish [plaste &amp; chose pleine] in a way so that they are pressed closely together and easily stripped from it. And only a half [of the grapes] should be molded. Or, if you have some of those grapes called chauches or sauvignons which have well-pressed grapes, set half of the grapes in the dish of <m>clay</m>, and cast on the other half, and if any grape is not stripped from it, pluck it out. Note that a grape whose grapes are set apart and separated cannot mold well in either <m>sugar</m> or <m>metal</m> because the ends of the cluster are so fine. Similarly, if the grape is kept, that it cannot hold the bunched grapes. Therefore, a hollow should be cast, which you will not be capable of if the grape is not close together and without having them spread apart.</ab>

+ In order to mold pears and apples in <m>sugar</m>, do not cast. Rather, fill half of the mold, and then join the two [halves], and keep turning [it] until the <m>sugar</m> is solidified and cold. Do not mix anything in the mold except the reheated <m>plaster</m>, as you know.</note>

The mold needs to have been soaked in cold <m>water</m> for one full day and night and [the mold] must be damp when you cast in <m>sugar</m>.</note>
 
<note>

The sign that the <m>syrup</m> or the melted <m>sugar</m> has boiled enough in the <m>water</m> for casting fruits is when it makes threads when shaking it. And if it passes this point, it will not be good because it will make [it] damp. If the <m>sugar</m> corrodes itself, throw a bit of <m>amidin</m> in the mold or rub it with an <m>almond</m>.</note>
