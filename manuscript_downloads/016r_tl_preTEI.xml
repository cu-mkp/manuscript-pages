<head>Melting <m>soft iron</m></head>


<ab>It is a common opinion that once <m>iron</m> has been melted, it cannot be remelted because they only heat it in small forges, in which it only catches fire. <pro>Alchemists</pro> are confident they can melt it with <m>realgar</m>, <m>lead</m> or <m>orpiment</m>. But without all that, some have found a way to melt not only <m>hard iron</m>, like that used for <m>iron</m> pots, but also <m>soft iron</m>, used for <m>pigs</m> and <m>ingot bars</m>, which are the most difficult ones [to work with]. For this result they make a furnace that is one handspan and a half wide and two handspans deep, and the <fr>tuelle</fr>, which is the barrel marked "A" where the <m>bellows' pipes</m> fit, has to be placed midway through the depth of the furnace so that there is one handspan of the furnace opening on the tuelle and one handspan under it.</ab>

Each square handspan of the furnace's opening can hold one quintal and a half, and the round furnace handspan can hold two quintals.</note>

The <pro><m>iron</m> smiths</pro>, to make the <m>iron</m> run, at the opening of the forge, place two or three handfuls of <m>wallwort</m> [in the direction] they want to make the <m>cast iron</m> run, and that makes the <m>iron</m> wonderfully ductile and flowy.</note> 


<ab>It is necessary that the <fr>tuelle</fr> is inserted [through] to the middle of the furnace opening, which is a main clue for the secret because the wind will hit the edge and the wall, which makes up the center of the furnace and in that manner, it spreads equally everywhere, as well as above, like flames in a reverberatory oven, and thus heats much more; because if the <m>wind</m> hits the <m>melted or ready to be melted matter</m> perpendicularly, it would cool it down and it would stop it from running and melting. It is also necessary for the <m>bellows</m> to be activated by jumps and by the <m>water</m> <m>stream</m> as [happens] at forges, because in this way, <m>bellows</m> are activated with great precision and great speed, which the strength of <pro>workers</pro> could not duplicate. As you can see, the wall is thus raised up and the furnace [is laid] on the ground, at the edge of which you dig a pit, like at other forges. In order to put the moulds you want to cast inside, and for this purpose, you unstop the opening that you made at the bottom of the furnace to allow the <m>melted matter</m> to flow. You will be able to melt two quintals of <m>iron</m> each time and, in order to do this, you will choose the biggest <m>charcoal</m> you will find and put a measure of it at the bottom on the surface area of the furnace and pile up from the bottom to the top of the wall, in the shape of [an upside down "V"].</ab>

Some make a mould of the same size as the piece, then immerse it, then beat a <m>soft iron</m> piece cut to size, and when this bit is red hot, they beat it into the mould and round it out with a large file. These bullets are thought to be stronger than the melted ones which, being made of <m>hard iron</m>, are more prone to break.</note>
