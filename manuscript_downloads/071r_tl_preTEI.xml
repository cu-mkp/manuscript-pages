<ab>It softens like a paste when it is boiled in molten <m>wax</m>, and colors when boiled with the <m>grease</m> of a young <al>kid</al>, since that <sup>the grease</sup> of a <al>goat</al> would break it, especially if it is glazed.</ab>

<head>Streaked <m>wood</m></head>


<ab>The <m>elm</m>has in its knotty roots beautiful veins streaked with grey and black, and the <m>root of the maple tree</m> as well, but you must choose the grain of the <m>wood</m> carefully. <m>Maple wood</m> is given a certain yellow color and then varnished.</ab>

<head><m>Sugared</m> and <m>mulled wine</m></head>


When the <pl>English</pl> have a cold, they mull <m>wine</m> in this way. They heat <m>wine</m> in a <m>tin</m> pot until it boils, and when it becomes frothy, they light it with burning <m>paper</m> to determine if it is hot enough. After, to mull the whole of it, they pour it from one vessel into another, as if they wanted to churn "<m>eau panée</m>", and as they do it, someone else lights with a burning <m>paper</m> what is falling from the one vessel into the other, which looks like pouring fire. When the <m>wine</m> is mulled enough, heat it again a little while adding a few <m>cloves</m> and a sufficient quantity of <m>sugar</m>. And they <sup>the <pl>English</pl></sup> drink it when it is as hot as possible in order to cure their melancholy.</ab>


<note>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
<pl>English</pl> commoners put <m>sugar</m> in <m>wine</m> as a substitute for new sweet <m>wine</m>, which they cannot have because, owing to the long sea crossing, the <m>wine</m> loses its sweetness and clarifies itself before it reaches their country.</note>

<head>Weary <al>horses</al></head>


<ab>In order to restore a harried <al>horse</al>, they make it drink some of the aforesaid <m>wine</m> through a horn, and it finds itself disposed to do an even harder labor.</ab>

<head><m>Eau de vie</m></head>


<ab>The <al>Irish</al> do not drink any <m>wine</m> because they convert it into <m>spirits</m>, which they use almost as habitually as we use <m>wine</m>.</ab>
