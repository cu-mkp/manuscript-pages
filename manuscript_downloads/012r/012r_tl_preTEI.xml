<head>Molding <m>sulfur</m></head>


<ab><m>Sulfur</m> is made beautiful mixed with <m>soot black</m> or <m>pulverized bloodstone</m>, which makes it harder and stronger. Having let it melt well until it becomes liquid, like <m>oil</m>, mix it with <m>verdigris</m>, and you <del><fr>m</fr></del> will cast in <m>plaster</m> very cleanly a <al>lizard</al>, or something else.</ab>
 
<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
You must not cast it until it is well cooled &amp; has lost all of its lumps &amp; bubbles, and it has settled down &amp; become even like <del><ill/></del> <m>water</m>. The <m>soot black</m> gives it a fine luster &amp; makes it neater. The most beautiful yellow <m>sulfur</m> must be used, for the greyish &amp; lively <m>sulfur</m> is not good. Do not cast <env>in wind</env> &amp; <env>cold</env>, for it would become porous.</ab>

<head><m>Cimolee</m></head>


<ab><m>Cimolee</m>, otherwise known as <m><pro>fuller</pro>â€™s earth</m>, which prepares <m>cloth</m>, is excellent for molding hollow or in relief; &amp; if you want to reheat it, it must first be warm, &amp; reheat it gently on low, indirect flame, &amp; little by little, otherwise it would crack. Put the figure for reheating in a <tl>pot</tl> in an <tl>oven</tl>, or in a <tl>covered oven</tl>. It is very malleable, clean &amp; fine. <add>You can make a hollow for animals of <m>cimolee</m> &amp; cast <m>lead</m> in it.</add></ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
The work needs to be dry for 4 or 5 <ms>days</ms> before you reheat it. When you mold &amp; make a hollow in <m>cimolee</m>, do not press too hard, but gently, for it would crack.</ab>

<head><m>Paper</m></head>


<ab>The whitest &amp; finest is the best. And when the cavity is quite clean, as that of <m>sulfur</m> or <m>baked cimolee</m>, it is made very neatly. You can give it one or two layers of <m>white</m> with a border of <m>gold</m> to imitate <m>alabaster</m>. And after applying the <m>white</m>, you may burnish it with a <tl>tooth</tl>. But in order for it to be burnished, one needs to soak the <m>lead white</m> with <m>glair of the egg</m> &amp; <m>peelings from the <pa>fig tree</pa></m>. Or better, varnish your work with <m>white varnish</m>. In addition when you are molding with <m>paper</m>, as it starts to dry, burnish from the back with the <tl>tooth</tl>.</ab>

<head><m>Plaster</m></head>


<ab><env>Mountain</env> <m>plaster</m> is greyer, and <del>the</del> the one from the region of <pl>Albi</pl> is whiter. It must be heated over a closed fire, such as a <tl>reverberatory furnace</tl> or <tl><fr>fours de barbiers</fr></tl>. And the best to work with is the most recently heated one. It must be finely ground on <tl><m>marble</m></tl>. After preparing your hollow mold with <m>sulfur</m> or something else, &amp; <m>oiling</m> it, &amp; investing with a <corr>circle</corr>, temper not too thickly your <m>plaster</m> with <m>water</m>, &amp; stir it well with your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl>, and if it makes lumps, throw in more <m>powder of the said plaster</m> &amp; <del><ill/></del> grind it with your <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> until <figure>+</figure></ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
<figure>+</figure> it makes no more lumps. Then immediately throw in &amp; sprinkle <m>plaster powder</m> &amp; leave to set well, then scrape the powder off.</ab>
