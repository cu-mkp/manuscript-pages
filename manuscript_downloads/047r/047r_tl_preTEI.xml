Make <m>water</m> with the cornue, and no matter how little of it you touch the tooth with, the tartar and blackness will go away. It is true that it has a bad odor, but you can mix it with <m>rose honey</m> and a little <m>clove oil</m> or <m>cinnamon<sup> oil</sup></m>.

<head>Crucibles</head>


<ab>Those from <m>Bayonne</m>, which seem to be made of <m>grès</m>, are better because they last, without comparison, longer than others. And since they are not very thick, one wastes less <m>charcoal</m> to melt <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m> because they are quickly heated. They do not absorb <m>silver</m> as much as others, and for this reason, there is not much laveure to be found in them. They are also not as likely to fall over as others that have a flat bottom.

The root of <m>consolida maior</m>, crushed and put between <del>pieces</del> cuts in a piece of <m><al>beef</al></m>, then boiled, rejoins them, as it is said.
