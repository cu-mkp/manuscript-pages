<head>How to <m>oil</m> paint <m>azure enamel</m></head>


<ab>This is a secret hardly known to common painters. Some take the finest they can and grind it with some <m>ceruse</m>, which binds it, and then prick with an awl in several places the areas they want to paint with <m>azure enamel</m>, so that the <m>oil</m> soaks into it in drops, not allowing the <m>azure,/m>, which alone is heavy, to run. Others lay the painting flat and apply the <m>azure</m> and that can be also soaked. The most important is to grind it well on <m>marble</m>, and before that, to have rinsed it. Some grind it thoroughly with an <m>egg yolk</m> and then rinse it five or six times and apply it not with a paint brush, which would be too soft, but with a brush highly softened and curled, and laying it down thickly as if you were applying it with a trowel, it settles even and flat. I experimented [and found] that grinding <m>azur enamel</m> with <m>egg yolk</m> and then rinsing it in <m>water</m> is good. However it does lose a little vividness when ground. I also rinsed it successively in <m>water</m> and, after letting it stand, I extracted some <m>blue water</m> with a sponge and pressed it into another vessel where it was left to stand, and from the residue I obtained the dust, flower and finest part of the <m>azure</m> without grinding it, which is the best way, because it loses some of its color when ground. Those who make it in <pl>Germany</pl> compose it like <m>enamel</m>, in large pieces which they pound, pass through several <m>sieves</m> and rinse.</ab>


<ab>To make <m>azures</m> beautiful, they wash them or soak them in <m>rock water</m>, as they call it, which is <m>water</m> distilled from mines where <m>azure</m> or <m>vert d’azur</m> is found, either distilled naturally through the mountain’s veins or distilled with an alembic from <m>azure</m> or <m>copper</m> mineral stones.</ab>


<ab><m>Azure dust</m> is not good for landscapes because it fades with <m>oil</m>. Only true <m>azure</m> holds. <m>Azure enamel</m>cannot be worked if it is too thick. Therefore, try it on your fingernail or your <m>oil</m> [color] palette. If it is sandy, grind it only with <m>egg yolk</m> or, even better, rinse it in <m>clear water</m> and with a sponge extract the <m>colored water</m> after it starts to sink, and in this way you will extract the finest flower, which will be easy to work with.</ab>
