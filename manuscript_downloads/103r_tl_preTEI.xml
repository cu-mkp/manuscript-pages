<head>Excellent burn relief</head>
<ab>Heat <m>linseed oil</m> on a light fire, without letting it boil and simmer. But when it is hot put a quarter part<sup>(of the quantity of the linseed oil)</sup> of the newest <m>wax</m> you can find. Once it has melted, let it cool and when it begins to curdle, stir it continuously with a new wooden spatula for the length of time it takes to say 9 pater nosters, and while you say them, wash this composition with <m>holy water</m>, always stirring. Having said the first of 9 pater nosters, pour the first <m>water</m> out and add more, then wash and stir the composition for the time it takes to say 8 pater nosters. In the interval it takes to say 3 of the 7 pater nosters, and continuing thusly, add more <m>water</m>, as above, until there is only one last new pater noster left.Then you will have a soft white ointment, with which you will apply to the burn for 9 days. But don’t apply any more, you must let the flesh grow over. Dress it twice a day and each time you wash your face with water, and mix it together a bit tepidly, without rubbing. But press it with wet <m>linen</m>, and wipe it similarly with fine <m>linen</m>, and apply the ointment. On which you can put <m>binder’s string</m>. This will regrow your hair and prevent a scar from forming. A <pro>powder maker</pro> who was completely burnt but had no sign of burns taught it to me.</ab>

<head>Against dog’s gall.</head>
<ab>The English, who fawn over their dogs owing to the care they take of their livestock, have healers for them <sup>the dogs</sup> who hold this particular office, and who melt <m>pitch</m> in water and, leaving it wet, rub the dogs with this water or with water sublimate.</ab>
