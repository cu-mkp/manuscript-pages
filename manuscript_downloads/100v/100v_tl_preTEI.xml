<ab>Take white <m>pebbles</m> that are found along rivers, along gravel banks, &amp; paths and that are somewhat transparent. If they are perfectly transparent, it will be better. If not, use the best &amp; whitest ones that you can find. Calcine them three or 4 times in your <tl><fr>four à vent</fr></tl> &amp;  quench them in <m>water</m> or <m>vinegar</m>. Afterward, take a <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of them and pound them in a completely pure <tl><m>copper</m> mortar</tl>, with a <tl>pestle of pure <m>copper</m></tl>, and grind them until they become very fine and soft powder; this is a sign that they have taken enough of the substance of<m>copper</m> to give them greenness. Then in your <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of <m>pebbles</m>, add in three <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of good <m>minium</m>, unadulterated by <m>brick</m> or something else, and strongly pound everything together again in a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>. And in all of this, add in a <ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> of <m><fr>sel de verre</fr></m>, &amp; some and the common people put in <m>sandever</m> that they find it among the <pro>glassmakers</pro> or <pro>apothecaries</pro>. But <m>alkali salt</m>, as you know, is better.

In this way, the <fr>vulgaire</fr> makes <m>emeralds</m> &amp; casts them in sand. If you do not have a <tl><m>bronze</m> mortar</tl>, crush in a <tl>cauldron of pure <m>copper</m></tl>.</ab>

The <tl>crucibles</tl>need to be reheated before putting materials in, and need to be put in the <tl>forge</tl>[a] or <fr><tl>four à vent</tl></fr> instead of making &amp; increasing the fire.

A <ms><fr>gros</fr></ms> of <m>salt</m> in four <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of <m>pebbles</m> &amp;<m>minium</m>. When one says: for <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure>, what is to be understood is: an <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of body &amp; not of <m>salts</m> &amp; <m>minium</m>.

<head>For <m>ruby</m> take <m>gold</m>in leaves</head>
 
<ab>Raise your <tl>stove</tl> by two <tl>tiles</tl> all around because more heat is needed to make <m>rubies</m> than <m>emeralds</m>. And take an <figure><ms>℥</ms></figure> of white, calcined <m>pebbles</m>, and put it in a <tl><m>glass</m> mortar</tl> &amp;, having roughly pounded it with the same kind of <tl>pestle</tl>, mix in the weight of a <ms>grain</ms> of <m>gold</m> leaves of the kind used by <pro>painters</pro> for gilding, &amp; crush.</ab>

Some say that mixing the <m>gold</m> with <m>pebbles</m> and <m>saltpeter</m> gives the color of a <pa>peach tree</pa></ab>.


<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
Others say that the <m>gold</m> has to be cemented several times and then beat into leaves.</ab>
