<head>Gilding <m>wood</m></head>
<ab>First of all it is necessary to apply a coat of very clear <m>glue</m>; and when it is dry, you will apply a coat of <m>yellow gold</m>; and when this is done you will take <m>fig tree wood</m> and soak it for a while, and wash the place you want to gild, and cut your <m>gold</m> with a knife near where you will put it; and you must apply said <m>gold</m> with <m>cotton</m>, and if you can find some <m>fig tree</m>, take an <m>egg white</m> and stir it frequently.</ab>


<ab>
If your <m>gold</m> does not have a nice enough color, you will take a <m>partridge feather</m> burn it in a chafing-dish, and turn the smoke toward what you have gilded.</ab>
