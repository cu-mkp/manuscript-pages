<head>To whiten the face</head>


<ab>Pound <m>puffball</m> in <m>cistern water</m>, and no other, and wash with this whitened water. This is highly regarded. And I believe that making it from <m>starch</m> and using that would be even better.</ab>

<head>Against windiness, colic, etc.</head>


<ab><m>Sap squeezed<sup> from orange peel</sup></m> or<m> water distilled from orange peel</m> is excellent against windy colics. <m>Candied orange peel</m> is also excellent for stomach winds. And to try it, having poured <m>sparkling wine</m> in a <m>glass</m>, press <m>orange juice</m> on the <m>wine’s foam</m>, which comes only from vapor and wind, and you will see that the foam will immediately disappear. Also, if you squeeze juice against a candle it will burn brighter.
