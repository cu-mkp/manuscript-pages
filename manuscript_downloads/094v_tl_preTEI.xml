<ab>The <m>gold</m> handles are made with some <m>yellow thin cloth</m> set below or other kind of <m>chalk-yellowed fabric</m>. And this <m>cloth</m> is set on with <m>glue</m> or aforesaid <m>gum</m>. This is in order to make the <m>thread</m> hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the <m>silk</m> ones and between two cordons are put one or two <m>threads</m> to enhance it. The <m>silver</m> one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the <m>silk</m> one, not because <m>silk</m> is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine <m>gold</m> handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.</ab>
