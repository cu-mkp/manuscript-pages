<head>Excellent temper for breastplates</head>


<ab> Have the clearest and the most running <m>river water</m> you can, and heat it up slightly more than warm. Then have a bunch of <m>reseda,</m> take its seeds and dip them into the said <m>water</m> and bring it to a rolling boil it while stirring it with a <m>stick</m>. Then pour it into a muid or any other vessel, then throw into it two pecks of <m>salt</m>. </ab>


<ab>Then take a big cauldron full of the said <m>river water</m> and heat it up slightly more than warm. Take three or four times the quantity of <m>red greasy earth</m> you can hold in two cupped hands, dip it and throw it into the cauldron filled with the said <m>water</m>. Have as much <m>pigeon manure</m> as of the said <m>earth</m>, as much <m>horse manure</m> and as much <m>iron scrapings</m>. And mix each of these separately, throw into the caldron and leave for two or three days. Then throw it into the said muid and stir all strongly altogether. And the older this temper is, the better it will work.</ab>

<head><m>Varnish</m> for <m>distemper</m></head>


<ab>You can make <m>marble</m> by <m>distemper</m> from <m>lake</m> or <m>rose of <pl>Ghent</pl></m> &amp; <m>chalk</m>. Once dry, glaze with <m>lake</m> mixed in <m>wine</m>, for the <m>glue</m> makes it die &amp; blacken. And all will then appear red, but the <m>varnish</m> you will put here, which will penetrate, will make dark &amp; light parts appear as they ought to be. The <m>varnish</m> is made thus, mix with <m>clear <pl>Venice</pl> turpentine</m> some <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> <del>&amp;</del> until all is clear &amp; liquid enough, &amp;it is done without fire. This one <del><fr>es</fr></del> is for things in <m>distemper</m>, and the <m>turpentine varnish</m> that you know, for panels. <m>Pure <pa>spike lavender</pa> oil varnish</m> is not good for panels, for <m><pa>spike lavender</pa> oil</m> is too penetrating &amp; makes colours sparkle, unless it was made long ago.</ab>
