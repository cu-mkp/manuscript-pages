<ab>Some cast in well-crushed <m>ceruse</m>, and others <del/>in <m>flour</m> moistened several times with <m>oil</m><del/> and dried in the sun.</ab>
 
<ab>Others, for casting in <m>lead</m>, use old printers' letters or types for the setting of letters.</ab>


<ab>Others add to the <m>tin</m> or <m>lead</m> a material of fixed <m>quicksilver</m> which makes it run.</ab>
