<head>For making <m>millas</m></head>


<ab>You must have some <m>millet</m> soaked in order to remove the <m>chaff</m> and then clean it well. Next you must grind it again quite finely and pass through a cloth sieve. One must soak the <m>flour</m> with fresh melted <m>butter</m> and some <m>milk</m> so that it is very light, like the <m>pastry</m> to make <m>beignets</m>, and add <m>egg yolk</m> depending on the amount of <m>flour</m>, so that there are two <m>egg yolks</m> for each <m>millas</m>. Then you will put in some <m>saffron</m> if you want to give them a little colour.</ab> 


<ab>Afterwards you must have some moulds, which must be made from <m>terra[cotta]</m>, in the shape of the bottom of the catholic hat, but it must be open at both ends. And then, having made a good fire, clean where you want to put your <m>millas</m> and then take your molds and grease them very well so that the <m>pastry</m> does not stick to them when baked. Once you have done that, put your molds in a place in the oven where you clean and sprinkle a bit of <m>flour</m> on the bottom and fill them with some of the aforementioned <m>pastry</m>. Then you will cover the said molds, with a lid made like the mould, but it must be bigger and not open at the top. Then once done, you will put some <m>straw</m> on the said lid and a lot of hot <m>charcoal</m>, and set a fire around it, once done, you will […] one from it after a bit of time and will see when it is baked, it will be hard.</ab>

<ab><m>Glass from <pl>Lorraine</pl></m> is smoother and more even than <m>plate glass</m>. It is more durable and enduring. But how it is achieved by veins like it is vein-like scattered like straight lines as […] which happens because once the <pro>glassmakers</pro> have made it put it still hot on <m>straw</m> which therefore stains it. One can, however, rub it off with some varnish, <m>salt</m> and other <m>drugs</m> used by <pro>glassmakers</pro>. <m><pl>Lorraine</pl> glass</m> is sold by bands and each band is composed of three panels. A band costs usually X lbs. The <m>plate glass</m> is made in <pl>France</pl>, it is whiter and clearer but it does not last as long as that from <pl>Lorraine</pl>. It is also usually […] And in that case, it is better to cut little lozenges rather than large square pieces in the shape of a frame because they cannot sit themselves well evenly.</ab>
