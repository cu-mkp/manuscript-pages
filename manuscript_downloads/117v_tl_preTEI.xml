<head>To make the waste of flowers and herbs leave molds</head>


<ab>Some people put <m>quicksilver</m> inside. But, if it is a little work, or fine &amp; delicate foliage, that only has a slender issue, they make two errors: the first, that <m>quicksilver</m> by its heaviness can destroy some delicate tract inside in coming out, the other, that some bit will always linger inside that will make [other] <m>metals</m> sour &amp; inhibit the perfection of the casting. It is true that if it is to empty the mold of some large animal that has big conduits &amp; passages through which the <m>quicksilver</m> can easily exit, like of a bird or a serpent, one can indeed put some amount of <m>quicksilver</m> to break the calcinated bones of the animal in escaping, because of which the said <m>☿</m> will empty out &amp; not remain at all.</ab>

The asparagus stalk is so hard that most often it perseveres as charcoal. Because of this, do it rather dried out or wet it with <m>sulfur oil</m> &amp; that of <m>turpentine</m>, or indeed cast the little branches separately &amp; solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through with a wire.</note>

If the burnt thing has left behind some filth or ash, let it cool down a little, &amp; with an <m>iron</m> <m>wire</m> wrapped in <m>cotton</m> that can bend with the cavities that you have, investigate. Clean &amp; blow to a fault, either with a soft brush or a clipped brush.</note>

<head>Daisies</head>


<ab>They can be cast well in <m>gold</m>. But if you want to <m>enamel</m> them, you have to make them by hand &amp; <m>enamel</m> them &amp; then attach them. Otherwise, the leaf would be so pressured that it would encrust the <m>enamel</m>.</ab>

<head><m>Sand</m> that has already been used</head>


<ab>Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with <m>stone allum</m>, you can use it in the mixture of other things &amp; it can serve in place of brick.</ab>

<head>Molding à noyau <m>wax</m> figures or <m>lead</m> medals</head>


<ab>Rub them with <m>oil</m> with a brush. But be sure that it be so softly that your medal be barely wiped with it &amp; that it hardly appear to have been greased. After rub it with <m>spirits</m> and heat the <m>water</m> with which you will wet your <m>sand</m>, that of <m>plaster</m>, <m>brick</m> &amp; <m>alum</m>, so that being sort of lukewarm when you cast it, the <m>oil</m> will not refuse it, as it does with cold water, &amp; do not forget to moisten your <m>sand</m> with it, mixing it always with a little <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>

Medals molded in this way are very fine.</note>

<head><m>Snakes’ blood</m></head>


<ab>If you have to cut some snake inside a mold in order to burn it, cut it far from the intake of the mold so that no <m>blood</m> at all remains, because it makes a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same <m>quicksilver</m> &amp; removes impressions from your mold.</ab></root>
