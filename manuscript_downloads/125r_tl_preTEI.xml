<ab>and with your pipes and abrevouers, you can also place small threads of <m>wax</m> which are applied to the body so that the <m>metal</m> goes more easily from one part to another and runs quickly throughout. And with these pipes, you can guide
your cast and your vents without having ruined anything.</ab>

small rolls, you make your casts and vents without danger of chipping or [...] any of the mold because the <m>wax</m>, once it has been removed, leaves a thoroughly empty place. Make your vents proceed from the head [of the cast], which is at the bottom, towards the cast. Make your cast so that it is not thick, and make two or three notches inside the passage because this impairs the furie of <m>metal</m>. And it makes it flow easily without filling with bubbles, [and] it does not make too much smoke which dams up the passage. You can also divide it into two or three branches thusly when it [...] with the molded thing, and always make holes in the cast.</note>

<ab>When you mold something in order to cast with <m>wax</m>, first mold only <m>plaster</m>, you mold with <m>plaster</m> [that is] only reheated after [it] has been pulverized. Because, once [it] has been reheated on the <m>stone</m> slab, the outside is burnt, and the inside remains nearly unburnt. Transparent grey <m>plaster</m> is not strong, but the good one [<m>plaster</m>] becomes white once it has been soaked, and [it] sets well quickly. Nevertheless I have found the grey [<m>plaster</m>] to be quite firm and hard after it has set, but it takes longer [to work with it]. Know the nature of each. You will never mold very neatly if you do not soak until it is quite clear and liquid, your <m>plaster</m> or the core’s <m>sand</m>. Soak it straight away after it has been reheated.</ab>
 
<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
However, if you mold with <m>plaster</m> that has been reheated once as said, coat the first mold well with <m>oil</m>. And when the second cast has set and you have prepared it, soak it in <m>water</m> for a long time. And if it does not strip, soak it in hot <m>water</m>, because cold <m>water</m> hardens it.</note>

<ab>And hot <m>water</m> softens it [<m>plaster</m>] more than cold <m>water</m> [which] does not penetrate it [<m>plaster</m>] as [it does] <m>mixed</m> <m>plaster</m> because it [<m>plaster</m>] is stronger and <m>mixed plaster</m> is spongier. <m>Medal</m>s are cast from this <m>powder</m>ed, reheated <m>plaster</m>, [and the <m>medal</m>s] will be waterproof as though they were <m>varnish</m>ed. In Germany, people hang these <m>medal</m>s on houses. See to it that the <m>water</m> is very hot, and if the <m>water</m> is boiling, it will not endanger [it]. All molds [made] of plaster only or molds [made of] <m>mixed</m> <m>plaster</m> are stripped from it.</ab>

<head>Scimitars</head>


<ab><pro>Workers</pro> from Damascus or from Hungary, neighbors to the Turks, separate <m>iron</m> from the <m>mine</m>s with <m>steel</m>. And they cast the blades of the scimitar in <m>sand</m> with this first <m>steel</m> [that was] first melted from its <m>mine</m>. Afterwards, they [the blades] cut other <m>iron</m> without without great difficulty because all melted <m>iron</m> is harder than soft <m>iron</m> beaten into [...] and bars. Thus is the <m>steel</m> of scimitars, but it is quite brittle. When someone takes the haft of a scimitar off, that person recognizes [it] well by the tip in the haft which is cast in <m>sand</m>.</ab>
