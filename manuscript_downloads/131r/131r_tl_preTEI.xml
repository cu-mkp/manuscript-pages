<head><m>Herbs</m> difficult to burn in the mold</head>


<ab>Mold them in two or three castings; being annealed, your mold will open, and it will be easier to extract the <m>charcoal</m> from inside. </ab>

<head>molded letter <m>paper</m></head>


<ab>Write with some <m>ink</m> well thickened with gum or any other <m>color dye</m> which has body, and which is not erased if dampened with brandy. Then put your paper on the sheet of clay, and dampen it with <m>brandy</m>. Cast both sides <x>of paper</x>.</ab>

<head>Adorning beds, mirrors and similar things</head>


<ab>Model any drawing in half relief on a flat <m>slate</m> in order to set it on round or flat things. Cast  with very fine <m>tin</m>, then you can gild it with <m>gold</m> leaf, and set it wherever you want. Fill the bottom of the relief with small <m>rubies</m>, <m>orpiment</m>, or any colored little <m>grains</m>.</ab>

<head>Training a dog </head>


<ab>You need to keep your dog attached; when it does what you command, to win its love, give it a piece of <m>cheese</m> that was held under the armpit. This <m>cheese</m> would be a bad drug if the master, or the apprentice, is red-haired. </ab>

<head>Molded <m>wax</m></head>


<ab>Wax representations made from <m>white lead</m> and <m>cerussite</m> are not made to be burned and melted in a mold where you want to cast <m>silver</m> and <m>gold</m>; this would make it brittle. Moreover if you use such a mold, the <m>wax</m> would be stripped thanks to the violence of the fire which makes it boil, and the mixture made of <m>cerrusite</m> or any other metal would attack the mold. That's why if you want to sketch things</ab>

<figure>+</figure>
<m>White wax</m> is more delicate than the other, and it doesn't leave any filth when you want to mold it as a core, or to mold hollow.</ab>
