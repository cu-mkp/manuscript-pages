<ab>with the <m>material of a frying pan</m> mixed with a knob of <m>potin</m>. And before that, I had so reheated my molded box frame, now on the flame of my stove, now putting glowing <m>coals</m> beneath it, that it became almost red. I let it cool and cast it. It came out with a quite neat relief on one side &amp; hollow on the other, as much the figure as the letters. It is true that the material was whitish, as though it were metallic, but this was because of the <m>potin</m>. I made another cast with <m>frying pan material</m>, alone in the same <m>sand</m>, but not as reheated. It did not come out well.</ab>
 
<ab>Then I molded burned <m>bull's foot bone</m>, pulverized &amp; strained through a double sieve, and wet with <m>egg white</m> or <m>wine</m> boiled with <m>the root of an elm</m>. I lightly knocked on top of it while molding. While opening the box frame, I found that the figures had come out not at all clean &amp; it left the molds as though they were floury &amp; crumbling. I wet the <m>bone sand</m> more so that it held together well between the figures, and in this way I molded neatly with good come-away. And even though it seemed like the ground <m>bone</m> was lumpy, when casting with <m>frying pan material</m>, it turned out that my figures were quite clean. It is true that I had really really heated up my box frame, it did not admit but one cast. I find that, when a <m>sand</m> is so fine that it gets as heavy as <m>ceruse</m> &amp; even, without finding it arid, thin, sandy &amp; rather spongy, that <sup>sic</sup> it molds quite neatly but it does not receive <m>metal</m> very well, as if it were porous and sucking up the material. But, being fatty &amp; even, it puffs up &amp; does not receive subtle impressions at all. I believe that the secret of casting well lies in finding a <m>sand</m> that conforms well to the <m>metal</m>, this one for <m>lead</m>, the other for another, because each has its own particular one, so that it be molded easily and keenly. Then let it firm up on its own for a few days if you have the leisure for it.  And afterwards let it really heat up again, not instantly nor with a large fire, but little by little, otherwise it will crumble &amp; always have some defects. Finally you must cast <m>copper</m> or <m>latten</m> or other <m>great metals</m> very hot and if possible with a large quantity of material that has a lot more heat than a small quantity. It's necessary that the box frame be cold &amp; that you cast all in one go. Always lute the opening of your box frame because <m>metal</m> touching fire or <m>metal</m>. </ab>

This <m>bone</m> has to be really crushed in a mortar, it must not be reheated very much, because then it would crumble.</ab>
