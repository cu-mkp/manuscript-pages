<m>Crocum ferri</m> hardens moulds that have been reheated, the more <m>feather alum</m> is added, the softer and pliant they become.</note>

<head>Making <m>silver</m> runny</head>


<ab>If it is for a large work, <m>arsenic</m> and pulverized <m>tartar</m> thrown into melted <m>silver</m>, makes the <m>silver</m> runny. This is enough [for silver.]  But for subtle work, you need <m>bronze, filings, copper,</m> even <m>antimony</m>, <m>sublimate</m>, all neatly ground. All of this makes a mass that does not get smaller.  If the <m>plaster</m> is good, you do not need to add <m>crocum</m> for <m>silver</m>, but one puts in more <m>feather alum</m>. It is also necessary to add melted <m>common salt</m>, and some <m>saltpeter</m> and the aforementioned drugs: <m>arsenic, tartar, bronze, copper filings, antimony</m> &amp;</ab>

<head>Keeping dried flowers in good condition year round</head>


<ab>This is a rare secret, and which is pleasing for decorating tables, rooms, studies out of season when winter denies you flowers. Be advised to pick them when they are in full vigor and still growing, because if you take them when no longer in bloom or when they are starting to wilt, they will not keep.  Having therefore chosen them, take some <m>sand</m>, the leanest and driest you can find, that must be very well ground, like the one <pro>goldsmiths</pro> use to sand <m>enamel</m>, or like the one [used] for engraving. But this <m>sand</m> must not be dusty at all, nor must it stay on your hand or leave a trace when you have ground or poured it, because it is</ab>


<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
<m>River sand</m>, that is washed by the current of water, is good when strained in a cloth to make the powder compact.</note>


<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
Flowers can also be kept just as beautifully in <m>vinegar</m>, distilled in a vase, well-sealed so it there is no draft, well-sealed with <m>wax</m> and <m>mastic</m>. [For] carnations and roses, the residue of <m>vinegar</m> usually makes them rot.  If the <m>sand</m> is dusty, and sticks to the flowers so that it hardly comes off with a brush, it is no good. The leannest <m>sand</m> is the best.</note>

<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
Make sure your box is well sealed so that the <m>sand</m> does not get out. Keep it uncovered in sunlight and keep it away from the evening dew, and the moisture of the night, and cover it and keep it in a dry place.</note>


<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
You can not put these aforementioned flowers in big vases, because if you want to take one out, you will take the whole bunch with it. </note>


<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
Be advised to not pick your flowers when it is rainy or humid, but when the sun has been shining on them.</note>
