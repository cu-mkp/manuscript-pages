<ab>The <m>gold</m> handles are made with some <m>yellow thin cloth</m> set below or other kind of <m>chalk-yellowed fabric</m>. And this <m>cloth</m> is set on with <m>glue</m> or aforesaid <m>gum</m>. This is in order to make the <m>thread</m> hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the <m>silk</m> ones and between two cordons are put one or two <m>threads</m> to enhance it. The <m>silver</m> one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the <m>silk</m> one, not because <m>silk</m> is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine <m>gold</m> handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.</ab>


<ab>The best sword point is of <m>sage foliage</m>.</ab>
 
<ab>This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from <m>rowan</m> which is hard and even.</ab>


<ab>The stick underneath which is folded bow-like is called the arch.</ab>


<ab>The stick above is called stick of the fustée.</ab>


<ab>And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustée.</ab>


<ab>There are two horns, one is called the <m>oil</m> hornet and the other the <m>emery</m> hornet. </ab>


<ab>There is an <m>iron</m> tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed <m>steel</m> called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with <m>stone</m> or other tools which leave some scratches.</ab>


<ab>To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened.</ab>


<ab><pro>Those who create sword hilts</pro> are different craftsmen than <pro>furbishers</pro>.</ab>


<ab>The fustée is a three-finger-thick, square <m>wood</m> tool, made of <m>boxwood</m> which fit in the middle of the fustée stick to furbish.</ab>


<ab>The fresil stick is made of <m>willow wood</m> which is to <x>…</x> weapon with some <m>clinker</m> which is the <m>iron scale</m> falling from the <pro>blacksmiths</pro>' forge.</ab>
