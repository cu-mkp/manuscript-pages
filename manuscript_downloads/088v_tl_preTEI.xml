<head><m>Sand</m> from pulverised <m>rock salt</m> and <m>sand</m> from a <m>mineral</m> finely ground on a <m>marble</m> [slab]</head>


<ab>After they have been dryly ground and beaten in the mortar, they are ground finely on the <m>marble</m> [slab]. I mixed the same quantity of each material, and in order to mix them better, I ground them on the <m>porphyry</m> [slab] again, and then filtered this through a double sieve or the sleeve of a <m>shirt</m>. Then, I put them on sheets of <m>paper</m> and stored it on a <m>marble [</m>slab] in a cellar. In one night, they were both moist enough [that there there was no need] to dampen them further because <m>rock salt</m>, like all other salts, dissolves in dampness. I molded with this very neatly because both should be quite fine. They should be moist enough so it can be removed easily [from the mold].</ab>

<ab>It does not matter if the [<m>sand</m>’s] color is white or yellow. Above all it [the <m>sand</m>] must be lumped [together] much like a precious stone or a stone, and the deeper [in the earth] you get it from the the better. The signs of its quality is that it is thus gathered together, that, if the <m>stone</m> is removed as it should be [i.e. in the correct way], it forms pieces and lumps [together], which demonstrates its [capacity for] binding, and that it [the <m>sand]</m> is not too dry.</ab>


<ab>However, it should crumble in your hands. And the grain must be quite small, fine, and homogeneous. If this [<m>sand</m>] is not fine enough, you can filter it and grind it up finely either with <m>water</m>, or through a sieve, or on the <m>porphyry</m> [slab]. That way it loses its dryness and becomes greasy and well bound. You can mold it in a box mold or in a mold without wool, and try it with <m>lead</m> because, if it does not swell and casts neatly, it will bear out well too […] Some say that fatty <m>sands</m> do not work for casting <m>metal</m> that is too hot. <pro>Artisans</pro> who undertake a big job and who want to save money do not need to crush [<m>sand</m>] and seek the curious [properties] of <m>artificial sand</m>; they have more to profit from finding natural sand that has the finest grain possible. And for a small job, they take advantage of finding the finest natural sand they can. For a smaller job, they only filter the sand through the sieve. But those who work on a very small scale crush the <m>sand</m> and grind it finely [until it becomes] impalpable, because they do not need as much [<m>sand</m>].</ab>

Ground <m>wheat</m> makes a tawny-colored powder [that is] quite fine and quite soft. Once this powder has been mixed, it can mold very neatly. Try <m>wheat flour</m> burned in an enclosed fire.</note></root>
