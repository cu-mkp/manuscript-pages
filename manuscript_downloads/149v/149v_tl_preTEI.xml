<head>Molding vases in several pieces</head>


<ab><pro>Goldsmiths</pro> who make large works and crockery use a turning lathe to get the model they wish in wood. Then with some <m>wax</m>, <sup><pro>the goldsmiths</pro></sup>model on top of this the masks, festoons, or anything that they wish. Then they mould the model in three, four, or several pieces.</ab>

<ab>They take on a <m>gold</m> penny a small pinch of refined <m>aloc</m>, as you would find in old sous. </ab>

<head>Molding <al>flies</al></head>
<ab>Large <al>flies</al> can be molded &amp; cast. But you must apply underneath their wings some <m>wheat oil</m>, which dries quickly and firms them up &amp; gives them a little thickness. The same thing can be done with <al>butterflies</al>, <al>cicadas</al>, <al>grasshoppers</al> &amp; similar things. But to cast them more easily, you must set them on some leaf or bouquet. The others should be placed by hand on a very slender <m>silver</m> blade. You cannot keep your insects when they are dead, since they will dry out and their legs will break.</ab>


<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>
<m>Wheat oil</m> should be put underneath delicate things to make them more rigid &amp; firm, &amp; to make them hold their natural posture, since being weak &amp; delicate, the tempered sand, adding weight to them, would change their form.</ab></div>

<head><al>Bats</al></head>
 
<ab>They have very thin wings and if they are large &amp; dry and the wings are extended, you need a very big mold &amp; it is not certain that the <m>metal</m> will run sufficiently; thus, when you want to mold some, choose the medium-sized ones &amp; and arrange them so that they have  their wings are half folded, since in this way they will come out better. But be sure to apply, as you known, some <m>wax</m> on the side of the wings, so that the cast flows well.</ab>
