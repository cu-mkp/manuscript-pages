<ab>The best, fattest and softest, is imported from Germany and is not in sows but in bands, of around an arm long and three inches wide. It is imported in Lyon and they use it in Nuremberg to make the [lead] leaves for small mirrors.</ab>

<ab>They also make their molds out of <m>metal</m> which last longer and cast more precisely than <m>earthenware</m> [molds], because the vessel is cast smoothly and evenly. But this is for the rich because a mold costs fifteen or sixteen francs. These <m>metal</m> molds are usually made for basins and ewers and salt cellars and similar things which are figurated.</ab> 


<ab>For pints, molds are made with <m>white clay</m> mixed with <m>horse dung</m> and <m>wool</m> and well beaten. Because the pints are deep half-circles, they will not be easily removed from the <m>earthenware</m> moulds, unlike the <m>clay</m> ones, which are softer.</ab>


<ab> Vents [souspirals] are made to <m>metal</m> molds, and we cast all at once, so that there is no smoky black line in the middle of the dish which comes from the <m>metal</m>'s steam and smoke when it is casted. This means that in that particular spot, the work is knotted and very often pierced. However they can fix this by soldering, as I have said. This smoke is found in the middle right half of the cast, and in <m>earthenware</m> molds.</ab>


<ab>The vessel can be hammered so that it will sell better, but it will not last as long.</ab>


<ab>Depending on the size of their dishes and plates, they have natches on the spoke of their <m>iron</m> wheels. And when they want to apply</ab>
