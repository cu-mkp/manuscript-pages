<ab>Fine <m>gold</m> is unfavorable for it, for <del><ill/></del> on the former it is yellowish. But alloyed <m>gold</m> is more favorable, such as that of <cn>escu</cn> &amp; <cn>pistolet</cn>. <del>If</del> <m>Gold</m> in its pale color decays the <m>enamel</m>’s hue. <del>Ma</del> And for this occasion, once cut, one puts it back on the fire to give it a reddish color to make <m>enamels</m> beautiful. Otherwise, they are subdued.</ab>


<ab>There is  <m>rouge clair</m> that once worn down with <fr><m>arene</m></fr> loses its beauty.</ab>


<ab>Some <m>rouge claire</m> is found with grains of <m>gold</m> inside. And it is also the opinion of good <pro>goldsmiths</pro> that the good one is made with <m>gold</m>.</ab>

<head>Casting with <m>gold</m></head>


<ab>Molds are recooked better &amp; more surely than otherwise in a closed fire, such as a <del><tl>pot</tl></del> a <tl>reverberatory furnace</tl>. So that when goldsmiths want to cast some piece of important work <del>d’<m>or</m> e</del> that cost a lot to rough out in wax, they put the <tl>molds</tl> in a <tl>pot</tl> &amp; recover them, &amp; fill the pot with earth, sustaining the fire that holds them unified &amp; tight. Then, they recook <tl>mold</tl>, <m>earth</m> &amp; <tl>pot</tl> together and when everything is quite red, they cast the <m>gold</m>. Fine <m>gold</m> does not run well, but rather alloyed <m>gold</m>.</ab>


<ab><m>Gold</m> and <m>silver</m> do not become brittle: once entirely red and hot, dip them into <m>water</m>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
<m>Gold</m> is a quarter heavier than <m>lead</m>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-middle</margin>
When <m>gold</m> reaches its perfect heat, it is green like an <m>emerald</m>.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
Take care that where you want to cast with <m>gold</m>, there must not fall any <m>lead</m>, <m>tin</m>, or <m>lime</m> thereof in the <fr>forge</fr>.</ab>

<head>A way to make the gate for small female <al>lizards</al></head>


<ab>Because you always have to make the gate by the tail, and that it is so delicate and thin that the <del>casting scarcely</del> metal would flow with difficulty, especially when the tail is folded, roll <m>wax</m> in little filaments of this size

and apply some with the hot <m>wire</m>, as said, one at the end of the tail &amp; others that correspond in the same way, from one <del>end</del> <add>side</add> of the tail to the other, as you see depicted. But take heed to do it with the end of the <tl>hot iron</tl> so that the end of the <m>wax</m> scarcely touches the animal, for the sand of the second gate will not touch this part.  But make the end of the <m>wax</m> arranges itself only at the end of the empty part of the first mold. Make as well channels of <m>wax</m> around the legs &amp;, around the contours of the body, which are a little long &amp; they will serve as a trough for the molded thing.</ab>

When the tail, which is delicate and closer to the gate comes out well, the rest will also come out well.</ab>

<margin>left-bottom</margin>
The most important is that the ears of the <al>snake</al> come out well-molded.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-bottom</margin>
Your gate must be very thin at the entrance of the animal &amp; of the thickness of a knife.</ab>
