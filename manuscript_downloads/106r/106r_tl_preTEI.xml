<head>To cast</head>


<ab><m>Asphalt</m> from Germany is the most excellent <m>sand</m> you can find for molding in a box frame, because it is fitting for <m>silver</m> &amp; for <m>gold</m>. &amp; the more you use it and the older it is, the better it is. With it, one molds very slender &amp; subtle things.</ab>

<head>Making <m>gold</m> run for casting</head>


<ab>Because <m>gold</m> cools down very quickly, you have to give it a mixture when it is well melted that will keep the heat. <m>Sublimate</m> softens it nicely. But, since it vanishes into smoke, it won't aid you for very long. Therefore mix this mixture into it when you want to cast it: of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, the best <m>verdigris</m> that you can find, a bit of <m>borax</m> &amp; some <m>saltpeter</m>. And this, held over the heat, will become neat. The <m>saltpeter</m> makes it clear &amp; heats it. But the key thing in this mixture is the <m>verdigris</m>, which has to be good. This mixture softens your <m>gold</m> so much that it becomes as tractable as lead, even if it is good <m>gold</m>.</ab>


<ab>For <m>sand</m> for molding flowers &amp; leaves &amp; other delicate things, mix in raw <m>plaster</m>, crushed <m>brick</m> &amp; <m>stone alum</m>.</ab>


<ab>To moisten <m>sand</m>, <m>spirits</m> are excellent because it makes <m>sand</m> fine &amp; leaves in a vapor when you reheat your box frame.</ab>


<ab><m>Dilute sal ammoniac</m> is very good, is excellent for moistening <m>sand</m>, but for lots of <m>water</m> you only need a little bit of <m>sal ammoniac</m>.</ab>


<ab>A raw lump of <m>metal</m>, if you don't have <m>crocum ferri</m>, is good for <m>gold</m>.</ab>


<ab>The snakes and the lizards you wish to mold should not be kept for a long time, because if they are alive, they will waste away, and if they are dead, they will decay.</ab>


<ab><m>Plaster of Paris</m> is as hard as stone &amp; very good. When you want to choose some for your <m>sand</m>, take the rawest and the hardest that is possible for you &amp; that does not make any powder. Transparent <x><m>plaster</m></x> and that which makes powder in giving way is that which is not good for this work. A sign of that which is near perfect is that it is hard &amp; makes shining grains that look almost like sugar. Finally, to mix it into the <m>sand</m> to cast <m>gold</m>, it has to be put in the <m>fire</m> twice, &amp; reheated twice.</ab>


<ab>
<margin>left-top</margin>
<figure>+</figure> When <m>gold</m> is really pure, it is so dry that it can just barely endure a hammer. But this mixture softens it like <m>lead</m>.</ab>
