<ab><m>Azure</m> is not good for that but l[illegible] and you have to work with long brushes. Frescoes cannot be made on <m>wood</m></ab></div>

<ab><m>Turpentine oil</m> makes it very beautiful, try some <m>palma christi seed oil</m>. <m>Nut oil</m> in the <pl>Flanders</pl> costs at least a hundred sols a pint. The <m>azur</m> requires some greasy <m>oil</m> for it is not thick</ab></div>

<head>Brushes </head>


<ab>When the color has dried inside them and you want to clean them soak them in some <m>aspic oil</m> and they will turn immediately soft again as before, then you will finish to clean them in some <m>nut oil</m>. <m>Nut oil</m>is not as appropriate to soften them as the <m>aspic</m> one which is clear like water and penetrates and is not as thick as the <m>nut oil</m>. Brush handles are made by the quirky ones of porcupine hairs, by some others with fine branches of <pl>Turkish</pl> <m>wood</m> with which they also make small sticks to rest their hand when they are painting</ab>

<m>Enamel azur</m> must not be ground even with some <m>water</m> for it dies and loses all its color. Because however it cannot be used if it is big, grind it not with some water but with some oil and grind it roughly and so it will not die</note>

Always choose the thinnest one</note>

To work properly on small scale you need some very fine brushes with a strong point. And because the <m>hair</m> taken from a <al>squirrel</al>’s tale is [mollesin], the most quirky ones use the of oldest <m><al>rats</al>’ hair</m> and even of <al>dormouses</al>  if they can find some and put two or three in the middle of a brush. These brushes draw a straight line like a quill and all the other <m>hairs</m> stick to them. The <m>hair of a <al>stone marten</al></m> or of a <al>weasel</al> and small animals used to make some <m>musk</m> are even better for just one <m>hair</m> is necessary in a brush</note>
