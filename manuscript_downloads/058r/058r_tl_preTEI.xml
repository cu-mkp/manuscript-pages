<ab>You must make at least three layers of flesh color in order to paint faces in <m>oil</m>. And to begin, one places the black and shadow where it is appropriate. After, the highlighting with <m>lead white</m> must not be placed on the black. Flesh colors and [missing word] containing <m>ceruse</m> will yellow in five or six months, but <m>lead white</m> does not change.</ab>


<ab><m><pl>Florence</pl> lake</m> is better than <sup><m>lake</m></sup> from <pl>Flanders</pl> because in <pl>Florence</pl> they make the best dyes. To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest and brightest <m>lake</m> is the best, because those that are purple and violet as a result of the addition of too much <m>alum</m> look like the flesh of someone that is very cold. That is why women who want to color their cheeks crush <m><pl>Florence</pl> lake</m> very finely, then fill a little <m>cotton</m> with it, which they then wrap in a little fine <m>cambric</m>. And thus they rub the <m>lake</m> on their <bp>cheeks</bp> and then, with another clean <m>cotton</m>, they soften it.</ab>
 
<ab><m>Crystallin</m> having been crushed in <m>water</m> appears to have body, but in <m>oil</m> it does not have any. It is crushed with <m>lake</m> and with <m>bitumen</m>, which would not dry for a very long time otherwise.</ab> 


<ab><m>Aspic oil</m> is commonly put with <m>lead white</m>, not entirely pure but mixed with a little <m>walnut oil</m>. The said <m>aspic oil</m> will not be good for <m>lake</m> and colors that do not have body because it will make them crack, but with those that have body and are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.</ab> 


<ab><m>Verdigris</m> and <m>orpiment</m> must be first crushed with <m>urine</m> rather than thinned with <m>oil</m>. Thus they are beautiful and do not fade.</ab>
