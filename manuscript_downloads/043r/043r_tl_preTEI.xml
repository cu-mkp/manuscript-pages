<ab>One must apply four layers of <pro>painters</pro>' <m>distemper glue</m> onto the <m>plaster</m> portrait, leaving one layer to dry at a time. Then apply gently some burnt <m>English point</m> ground on a marble slab, or some <m>lead</m> burnt, ground and distempered with a bit of <m>gum</m> or <m>glue</m>. When dry, rub gently with a little <m>cotton</m> and the <m>plaster</m> portrait will look like <m>lead</m>. Others grind <m>minium</m> with <m>quicksilver</m>.</ab>

<ab>The soft <m>tin</m>, <ms>half an ounce</ms> of, melt it in a <tl>spoon</tl>. Once melted, throw in an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>☿</m>, mix together. Once cold, grind on <m>porphyry</m>. Next take an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>sal ammoniac</m>, an <ms>℥</ms> of <m>sulfur</m>, the yellowest that may be found, grind both of them. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Next put all together into a <del><it>a pignatta</it></del> <tl><m>glass</m> sublimatorium</tl>, hold this over a small fire for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> &amp; for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> over a stronger one &amp; for an <ms><tmp>hour</tmp></ms> over a very strong fire, and it will be done. Next, to use it, apply <m>soot black</m> with the <m>glue</m> that <pro>painters</pro> use to paint, <del>&amp;</del> two or three times, until it is quite black. Next apply a little <m>varnish</m>. Once dry, apply the <m>purpurine</m> a secco with a <tl><bp>finger</bp></tl> where you want. The more you apply, the more beautiful it will be. Next, if you want, apply <m>varnish</m> on top.</ab>
