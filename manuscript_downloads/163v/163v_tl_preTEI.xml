<head><al>Crayfish</al></head>


<ab>The hairy little horns that it <sup>the <al>crayfish</al></sup> has under its snout tend to come out lumpy and unclear because, after they are burnt, it is difficult to remove and clean away their ash, which, staying in the mold, prevents the <m>metal</m> from running well. And for this reason, one makes a small gate of <m>wax</m> thread at the tips of them, in order both to hold them up and to blow away the cumbersome ashes from inside.</ab>
 
<ab><margin>left-top</margin>Do not spare any pins, placing them not only in the middle of the body, but also on the big legs, and two or three on the tail, according to the positioning that you want to give it.</ab>

<head><m>Crocum</m></head>


<ab>That which has become rusty by itself, having been doused with <m>water</m>, <m>salt</m>, and either <m>vinegar</m> or <m>urine</m>, and then well-dried and reddened by heating, is deep red when crushed on <m>porphyry</m> and is of the color of <m>bol de levant</m>, almost like <m>minium</m>. But that which is doused with <m>urine</m> and dried acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed <m>aes ustum</m> or like <m>vermillion</m>. But the first one, finely crushed, acquires a bright red color like <m>cinnabar</m> when placed in <m>spirits</m>. And the one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and fine, one throws <m>vinegar</m>, <m>urine</m> or <m>spirits</m> on top. The <m>urine</m> makes a lot of color and the <m>spirits</m> as well.</ab>

<head>Repairing</head>


<ab>It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a burin called an "onglet" or the one called "chaple" or with a small file. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While reworking, moisten and rub your work with a small <m>bristle</m> brush.</ab>
