<head><m>Sulfur oil</m> for the teeth</head>
<ab>Some people whiten them with compositions of <m>aqua fortis</m>, however we say that this corrupts them afterward and causes them to blacken. We say that <m>oil of sulfur</m> is excellent, but it must be applied in this way: take as much <m>clove oil</m> as can be held in a roquille de <m>noix</m>, as much <m>rose honey</m>, and seven or eight drops of <m>oil of sulfur</m>, and put it all together, and after having cleaned the teeth with a small burin, touch them lightly with a good bit of <m>cotton</m> dipped in the aforementioned oils and leave it for a little while, then spit it out or rinse the mouth with tepid water, and repeat two or three times. <m>Oil of sulfur</m> penetrates and is corrosive, but the <m>oil of cloves</m> and the <m>rose honey</m> correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.</ab>

<head>Against the falling sickness</head>
<ab>Have fresh <m>crow eggs</m>, either four or five, over the space of four or five mornings. Cook one and having mixed it in a bit of powdered <m>gentian</m> and a drop of <m>oil of sulfur</m>, give it to the patient. And hold it so the pain does not return any longer.</ab>
