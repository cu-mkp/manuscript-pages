<head>Molding snakes in all weather</head>


<ab>Snakes hide underground during winter. Some people feed them a lot in barrels filled with <m>earth</m> and covered with <m>droppings</m>. Other people make several molds in summer because you can make four or five molds with one single snake. Other people mold long, natural snakes without coils, using <m>common plaster</m>, annealed as said, with a core and two half-molds. Then they cast it in <m>wax</m>, that way they have a snake as twisted as they want. Then they cast <m>metal</m> as it is said.</ab>

If, while twisting your <m>wax</m> snake, some parts become undone, you can rework it if you remove the drips from the molded <m>wax</m>.</note>

<head><m>Tin</m> or <m>lead</m> mixture</head>


<ab>For fine herbs, flowers and greeneries. You need more than 3 parts of <m>tin</m> for one part of <m>lead</m>. If this material is thick and fat, you need 3 parts <m>lead</m>. Heat the mostly <m>tin</m> mixture, which must become red and very hot. When you want to cast, remove your crucible from the fire, and add two or three grains of <m>resin</m> for one and a half or two pounds of <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m>. With the <m>resin</m>, also some <m>fat looking-glass tin</m>, the size of an auclane with its shell, mix and cast. Make sure you have more <m>metal</m> than you need; some <m>metal</m> should be set aside. If you haven’t enough <m>metal</m>, keep casting and finish your cast, it will set, however it will not be so neat. Dip your mold into <m>water</m>, and dismantle your mold carefully with a point. Make an elongated cast in order not to damage anything. If you mold something very thin, you must make your cast with mostly <m>tin</m>.</ab>
 
<note>
<margin>#ERROR:_NO_MARGIN_AVAILABLE#</margin>
If you want to cast <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> as a core with the <m>sand</m> above mentioned, reheat your mold once only if there is nothing to be burnt inside. But if there are flowers or animals to be burnt inside the mold, reheat it twice. However do not reheat the second cast for as long as the first cast for <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>. As for <m>gold</m> and <m>silver</m>, those must be red when you cast. For <m>lead</m> and <m>tin</m>, let them cool down until you can dip your finger into the cast without burning yourself. The cast must be warm.</note>

<head><m>Copper</m> and <m>tin</m> casts</head>


<ab>For <m>copper</m> you must add <m>sal ammoniac</m>. It will clean it and remove the crust when melted. Some people add big pieces of <m>new leather</m>. Others add parts of <m>mule’s feet</m>. Other add melted <m>common salt</m> only, or <m>salt</m> melted with <m>saltpeter</m>. The main ingredients are <m>sal ammoniac</m> and also a little bit of <m>tin</m>, depending on the cast you want to do. <m>Copper</m> is harder to cast than <m>tin</m>. But when it is melted it runs better, even if alloyed with <m>tin</m>. Add a quarter <m>copper</m> to <m>tin</m> and mix it like copper. <m>Calamine</m> especially makes it run well.</ab></root>
