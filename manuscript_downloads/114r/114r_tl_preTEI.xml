<head>Second Casting</head>


<ab>When you have well molded the first part of the animal, that is to say the back, the spine, and the entire top part, and when the half-mold where the part is encased is hard enough <figure>

</figure> turn over the bottom and the sides of the belly, sometimes using a knife for the thicker parts, and then with a pen-knife for the places where the more fragile parts are encased, like legs, tail, and similar things. Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the animal himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the <al>lizard</al>'s throat more than you would do a <al>snake</al>, because the <al>lizard</al> has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the wet sand is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a cloth made of <al>swine</al> hair, slightly dampened into salt <m>water</m> or clear <m>water</m>, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered animal will be very neat. <figure>#</figure> <figure>üùã</figure> Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into <m>water</m> for a pater noster. It will suck water inside, that way when you'll rub with <m>oil</m> the uncovered side, the <m>oil</m> will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into <m>water</m>, take a particularly fine brush and rub with <m>oil</m> the entire mold but the animal; it should not be touched with <m>oil</m>. Make sure to use you brush between the parts and on all the fragile parts. And if by mistake <m>oil</m> is soaked, dip the mold into <m>water</m>, as it is said above, and drop by drop the <m>oil</m> will come back to the top.</ab>

Mold small animals as big ones, however, for small animals, use very fine tacks made of cords of cittern, short and long ones.</ab>

It is at the level of the head that you must make the biggest notch and you should start at that notch to expose and then keep following by looking at the traces left by the tacks. </ab>
