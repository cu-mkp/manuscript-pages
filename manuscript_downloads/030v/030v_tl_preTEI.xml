<ab>any bowl or plate, they enlarge and break with the strike of a hammer the <m>iron</m> wedges that has play in the spokes of the wheel. And, because they are on the notches and points where they should be, they tighten the aforementioned wedges [by] striking them with the hammer.</ab>


<ab>When their plates or bowls have been cast, soldered if needed, and purged anew of the burrs around with the hot soldering iron, and then with a big file. They adapt it on the wheel, and first of all wrap their kind of esgrusouer with a rope, as thick as the little finger, and lean it firmly on the crossing bar to secure it well. And while somebody else quickly turns the wheel, they guide the sharp edge of the esgrusouer by hand towards the edge of the round hollow, and gently guide it all the way to the center of the circle. And this esgrusoue is for removing the first rough and lumpy burrs of the work. And then, they unite it with a cutting iron called a plane, the sharp edge of which they rub with a bit of <m>putty</m> on <m>leather</m> nailed with a piece of <m>wood</m>. And this in such a way that the flesh or flower is on the outside, because if the sharp edge of this plane was not rubbed and polished, it would not burnish and polish the <m>tin</m>, which would remain white instead of black and polished as a mirror. Moreover, they repair with this plane for the second time the work as they did with the esgrusouer. Then, with a knife or other cutting iron, they scrape the edges of the plates or dishes to smooth them so that they do not get cut while handling them.</ab>
