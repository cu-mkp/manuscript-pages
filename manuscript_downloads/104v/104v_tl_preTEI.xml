<head>For casting</head>


<ab>If you've got a big piece which does not allow an easy stripping of casting, mold it with some <m>wax</m>, either on the hollow side or in relief, because it is soft &amp; hollow and so can easily be separated from the piece without leaving anything. But be sure that the melted <m>wax</m> is neither too hot nor too cold. Some people use for molding some <m>wax</m> warmed in <m>boiled water</m>, but while pressing the mold it bends &amp; becomes unusable. Once you have made your <m>wax</m> cavity, you can cast in some very soft &amp; clear <m>clay</m>, &amp; let it dry. Then, upon it you will make a <m>lead</m> or <m>tin</m> cavity, in which what you will make will easily be stripped.</ab>

<ab>Make an axle surrounded with wheels pierced all around in their thickness and attach feathers as for a cittern or a spinet &amp; arrange them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable distance. And, turning the axle either by yourself or by a clock spring, your invention will effect itself.</ab>
